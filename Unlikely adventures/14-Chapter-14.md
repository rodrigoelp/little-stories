# Earthshaker

How would you begin to describe a darkness so deep that it goes beyond the simple black colour?

It is hard to conceive it or imagine it, but, that was the colour of the sky as it observed with absolute fascination the pure white sand and a statue of a woman wearing a spider mask, as it stood still in front of three mounds of the finest most powdery sand.

Contrary to the sky, the statue didn't observe in fascination the three mounds because, well, it is a statue and, it is a well known fact that statues don't like sand very much.

Any how, the statue ignored the mounds which began moving gently, increasing its rocking motion as if someone wore a suit made out of sand had woken up from a terrible night out.



*"WAHG!"* - said one of the sand mounds as it turned into Amir. His arms released sandy granules as he forced himself to sit, then pushed a mouthful of pure white sand out of his mouth. He felt his lungs filling up with invisible particles of air as these rushed through replacing the cavities previously occupied by the fine powder.

*"(Cough cough cough)"* - woke up the second mound of sand shaping up to be Hannah, kneeling in between Amir to her left and a third mound of sand to her right - *"(cough) what (cough) just hap(cough)pen?"* - she said in an attempt to clear her airways.

*"MmmmMmm"* - explained the third mound forming the contour of a Sam sleeping on his side. He felt the sand in his throat and nose as it moved out; it was unpleasantly gritty and made him want to hurl.

*"The ground... it swallowed us whole!"* - stated Amir still feeling distaste to the insipid solid material. Every gulp of air felt precious and every exhalation was filled with fear the ground around them was going to feel particularly peckish and eat them again.

Hannah continued taking a deep breath, interrupted by her cough - *"I don't know (cough) how it was for you but, I don't (cough) want to experience that again."*

Sam felt sick, physically sick due to the commotion that brought him there - *Focus, nothing in here is real, nothing.* - he thought.

*"The sky is so black... We are in the odd world from before"* - observed Hannah looking around.

*"Uhm... at least, there is no water in here."* - she remarked with a certain edge to the tone of her voice that could be interpreted as a possible negative to the situation when it should have been a positive. 

Amir flinched at the memory of the cold painful water - *"At least we have that going for us. What should we do now?"*

*"First we need to understand what we are supposed to do. It clearly doesn't involve flying as we don't have our wings"* - stated Hannah analysing their current predicament.

*"We should start looking for clues about... Sam?"* - Hannah paused mid sentence at the sight of Sam's face getting noticeably green.

*"(BLAAEGH)"* - puked Sam, or so he thought as all he could see was the pure white sand on the ground.

*"This trial is... (BLAAEGH!)... I did not sign up for this."* - continued Sam in an attempt to finish a sentence - *"Nothing could be worse than this."*

*"Hold your combustible beer..."* - said Amir as he stood up in an attempt to help his friend. Amir's eyes were fixated on the area lacking the pure white sand - *"When Hannah said there was no water... she left out the ‘there is nothing else here!’ part"* - he continued.



Sam's eyes followed Amir's perplexed sight towards a void surrounding them - *"this... this is definitely not the same world we visited before"* - he added.



This new world was an artistic rendition of an archipelago in a surrealistic manner. The islands floated in the middle of nothing, untethered to a base, unsupported by anything.

The responsible artist must have had a monochromatic point of view as the scenery was void of colour, other than black and white of course; and shades in-between. It was one massive collective blob, clumped as an island, floating in a sea of spacetime.

The children had appeared on a satellite islet next to the main congregation, connected via a bridge of the same sandy material.

From there, they could visualise tall walls wrapping hidden contents beyond their imagination. Straight ahead of them, on the other side of the bridge the solid looking walls paused to reveal an equality impressive gate awaiting to be opened.



*"Whose castle is that?"* - said Amir still kneeling next to the recovering Sam.

*"Not a castle..."* - replied Hannah staring at the statue.

*"Then whose fort is that?"* - replied Amir not paying attention to Hannah.

*"Neither a fort nor a fortress."* - replied Hannah.

Amir continues examining the island totally surrounded by the massive wall - *"A prison then?"*

*"No Amir. It is a maze"* - continued Hannah feeling a tad irritated at the improvised comedian.

*"A maze? Isn't that like a hammer thingy?"* - continued Amir worried about the silent atmosphere around Sam.

*"Tsk!"* - angrily replied Hannah - *"No Amir. A mace is the hammer thingy you are talking about, a maze is like a labyrinth. A place designed to get you lost inside of it as you try to either escape or reach its middle."*

*"Oh, I see. Of course! A lantern-inn. Yes. I see."* - tried Amir to mimic the sounds Hannah had just produced. He lowered his voice and whispered to Sam - *"Oi, do you know about those lantern-inns?"*

*"Labyrinth Amir, a place that looks like this"* - explained Sam, drawing with his finger on the sand a series of circles connected by random lines.

*"Oh, that looks like a spider web"* - replied Amir, who after a few seconds of discerning the drawing felt cold shivers running down his back - *"... do you think there is a giant spider waiting to eat our face as it happened to this lady?"*

*"I think it is related to the spirit.  The spirit is the spider and the labyrinth is her home"* - added Hannah joining the conversation - *"come with me behind the statue. There is a stone describing this place."*



Amir helped Sam to stand up and the trio took a few steps to read a memorial stone near the statue.



```
To walk safely throuhg the maze of our cosmic existence, 
one needs the light of wisdom, 
the guidance of virtue and the simplicity of the heart.

Lose your way,
Be devoured by the spider.
```



Amir gave it a second read in silence - *this stone explained nothing* - he thought.

*"So... the way out is to go through the maze?"* - asked Sam.

*"I am afraid so."* - replied Hannah as she marched over the bridge towards the closed gate. Sam and Amir followed promptly leaving the statue behind.

*"Crickey!"* - voiced Amir as he got near the edge of the bridge - *"Better not to fall from here. I can't see the bottom! Perhaps there are monsters lurking down there, waiting to eat us all!"*

Sam decided, it was best to ignore the details of the bottomless pit behind and followed Hannah without thinking about Amir's horrid commentary. She had already reached two small pillars standing in front of the gates, each decorated with inscriptions.

*"What does it say?"* - queried Sam.

*"(Sigh) It looks like a riddle ‘Never will the rude pass by me; a courtly demeanour must have thee.’"* - read Hannah aloud, followed by silence as she decomposed the phrase.

Amir observed the tall gates made of firm bright white sandstone.

*"I got this"* - he said running towards the immovable object with firm determination to swing it open. On the other hand, the gate ignored a slightly concussed child that had clashed on its feet and remained on the floor as his friends gather around.

Hannah looked at Amir laying on the floor, dismissing his futile attempt and said - *"Uhm, Could you ‘please’ let us in?"*

A gentle rumble of gears moving heavily filled the environment to the surprise of the spectators, yet the gates maintained their position for a few seconds, then grains of sand dropped from above as the gates swung open revealing a narrow corridor sandwiched between white walls.

The children walked in, clumped together, filled with anxiety.

# Earthshaker

The black sky observed with absolute fascination the pure white sand and a statue of a woman wearing a spider mask standing in front of three mounds of an almost powdery sand that began moving, increasing its intensity as if someone wearing a suit made out of sand had woken up from a terrible night out.



*"WAHG!"* - said one of the sand mounds as it turned into Amir. His arms released sandy granules as he forced himself to sit, then pushed a mouthful of pure white sand out. He felt his lungs filling up with the invisible particles of air as these rushed through replacing the cavities previously occupied by the fine powder.

*"(Cough cough cough)"* - woke up the second mound of sand shaping up to be Hannah, kneeling in between Amir to her left and a third mound of sand to her right - *"(cough) what (cough) just hap(cough)pen?"* - she said in an attempt to clear her airways.

*"MmmmMmm"* - explained the third mound forming the contour of a Sam sleeping on his side. He felt the sand in his throat and nose as it moved out; it was unpleasant and made him want to puke.

*"The ground... it swallowed us whole!"* - stated Amir still feeling distaste to the insipid solid material. Every gulp of air felt precious and every exhalation was filled with fear the ground around them was going to feel particularly peckish and eat them again.

Hannah continued taking deep breath, interrupted by her cough - *"I don't know you but, I don't (cough) want to experience that again."*

Sam felt sick, physically sick due to the commotion that brought him here - *Focus, nothing in here is real, nothing.* - he thought.

*"The sky is black again... we are in the odd world from before"* - observed Hannah looking around.

*"Uhm... at least, there is no water in here."* - she remarked with a certain edge to the tone of her voice that could be interpreted as a possible negative to the situation when it should have been a positive. 

Amir flinched to the memory of the cold painful water - *"At least we have that going for us. What should we do now?"*

*"I don't know, we should start looking for clues about... Sam?"* - Hannah paused mid sentence at the sight of Sam's face getting noticeably green.

*"BLAAEGH"* - puked Sam. The substance coming out quickly changed into pure white sand, disappearing as soon as it touched the on the ground - *"... oh boy... I did not sign for this."*

*"Wow!"* - said Amir as he stood up in an attempt to help his friend - *"You said there was no water... but there is nothing else here!"* - he continued.

Sam's eyes followed Amir's perplexed sight towards a void surrounding them - *"this... this is definitely not the same world we visited before"* - he added.



The environment around them looked as if an artist decided to paint an archipelago in a surrealistic manner. The islands were suspected in the middle of nothing. Said artist must have had a monochromatic point of view as the scenery was void of colours other than black, white and shades in-between. One massive island floating in a sea of spacetime.

The children stood near the statue on a satellite islet connected via a bridge to the main formation. From there, they could visualise tall walls wrapping hidden contents beyond their imagination. Straight ahead of them, on the other side of the bridge the solid looking walls paused to reveal an equality impressive gate awaiting to be opened.



*"Whose castle is that?"* - said Amir still kneeling next to the recovering Sam.

*"Not a castle..."* - replied Hannah staring at the statue.

*"Then whose fort is that?"* - replied Amir not paying attention to Hannah.

*"Neither a fort nor a fortress."* - replied Hannah.

Amir continues examining the island totally surrounded by the massive wall - *"A prison then?"*

*"No Amir. It is a maze"* - continued Hannah, noticeably absentminded.

*"A maze? Isn't that like a hammer thingy?"* - continued Amir worried about the silent atmosphere around Sam.

*"Tsk!"* - angrily replied Hannah - *"No Amir. A mace is the hammer thingy you are talking about, a maze is like a labyrinth. A place designed to get you lost inside of it as you try to either escape or reach its middle."*

*"Oh, I see. Of course! A lantern-inn. Yes. I see."* - tried Amir to mimic the sounds Hannah had just produced. He lowered his voice and whispered to Sam - *"Oi, do you know about those lantern-inns?"*

*"Labyrinth Amir, a place that looks like this"* - explained Sam, drawing with his finger on the sand a series of circles connected by random lines.

*"Oh, that looks like a spider web"* - replied Amir, who after a few seconds of discerning the drawing felt cold shivers running down his back - *"... do you think there is a giant spider waiting to eat our face it happened to this lady?"*

*"I think it is related to the spirit.  The spirit is the spider and the labyrinth is her home"* - added Hannah joining the conversation - *"come with me behind the statue. There is a stone describing this place."*



Amir helped Sam to stand up and the trio gave a few steps to read a memorial stone near the statue.



```
To walk safely throuhg the maze of our cosmic existence, 
one needs the light of wisdom, 
the guidance of virtue and the simplicity of the heart.

The spider only devours those who lost their way, getting trapped in the web.
```



Amir gave is a second read in silence - *this stones explained nothing* - he thought.

*"So... the way out is to go through the maze?"* - asked Sam.

*"I am afraid so."* - replied Hannah, marching towards the close gates.

As the trio walked leaving behind the statue, Amir looked over the edge of the bridge - *"(Glup!) Crickey, better not to fall from here. I can't see the bottom!"*

Sam preferred not to know these details and followed Hannah marching firmly ahead. She had stopped to read two pillars aligned with the gates.

*"What does it say?"* - queried Sam as he approached Hannah.

*"(Sigh) It looks like a riddle ‘Never will the rude pass by me; a courtly demeanour must have thee.’"* - read Hannah aloud. She thought about it for an instant then said - *"Uhm, Could you ‘please’ let us in?"*



A gentle rumble of gears moving heavily filled the environment to the surprise of the spectators, yet the gates maintained their position for a few seconds, then grains of sand dropped from above as the gates swung open revealing a narrow corridor sandwiched between white walls.

The children walked in clumped together filled with anxiety. They stood still in the middle of the corridor looking at the possible paths. With the exception of the sand below their feet, everything else seemed to be made of sandstone, even the gates. From their point of view, the walls could easily be more than four times their height, though some walls had cutouts resembling window frames and some of the walls were sculpted into stairs.

The trio stood still analysing the corridor running from an elevated platform to their left to a passageway curving out of sight. Sam and Amir walked to the left in an attempt to find a safe path to take; Hannah walked . The path to the right came to an abrupt interruption as a gap removed a large part of the corridor, leaving three floating blowers, suspended in midair by invisible forces. The boulders rotated freely untethered to gravity, the tiny leverage of the air passing through made the boulders spin.



*"That does not seem safe"* - remarked Hannah looking apprehensively at the nothingness below the boulder.

*"We should go back, this seems like a dead end"* - she continued.

Sam observed the walls encasing the corridor, these had spider decorations discreetly carved at random locations. The all seem to run towards the corridor with the hole in it. He opened his mouth to report his finding but, Hannah and Amir had disappeared looking for a safe passage on the other end of the corridor. He followed.

Amir followed with his finger the little grey lines captured in the stratified sandstone. His little game of connecting the dots came to an end when he ran into Hannah's back.

*"Oouph!"* - Amir had landed on his rear as Hannah stared up, totally immovable - *"I'm sorry."*

*"Look there! There is a pillar up there"* - she pointed to a white gravestony-looking stone above, well, another large stone - *"I bet there is a clue written on it."*

*"What makes you think that?"* - ask Amir.

*"I looks just like the one outside"* - she stated trying to wedge her feet on the cracks of the stone in an attempt to climb up.

*"Oh yeah, now that you mention it, it does look like that stone outside"* - completed Amir.



Hannah's feet slipped, dropping her on the soft-ish ground below. An extended hand invited her to stand again - *"Thanks Sam"* - she added grabbing the hand.

*"No worries, what is there?"* - replied Sam.

*"The stone above it, I think it may have a clue or can tell us what to do."* - she stated dusting off her clothes; not that it needed it as their clothes didn't seem to get dirty. 

*"Maybe we can piggyback. You get on me, I get on Amir and then you try to reach up?"* - Sam explained the impractical idea.

*"Ah, here is says ‘Thou shalt plead mansit before venture ahead’"* - said Amir happily reading the stone.



Sam and Hannah stood quiet for an instance, returning around looking for Amir. Hannah looked up and saw Amir crouching beside the stone.



*"How?"* - she asked, puzzled at Amir's sight next to the stone.

*"How what?"* - queried Amir needing a little more context.

*"How did you get there?"* - she clarified.

*"Oh, that was easy! There is a rock thingy here, you jumped there, pushing yourself there to the other thingy, then here, stretched your arm up to here and then..."* - he explained naturally, just stopping and he failed to recalled the last three steps he made to get up there.



Hannah leaned closer to Sam and whispered - *"Is he half goat?"*

Sam limited himself to use his preferred way of explaining things. He shrugged.

*"What's that of the plead adventure?"* - asked Sam trying to remember the words.

*"Thou shalt plead ‘mansit’ before venture ahead"* - read Amir once more.

*"Mansit?"* - said Sam wondering about the odd word - *"What's mansit?"*

*"It means ‘stay still’ in old tongue"* - replied Hannah - *"How can we stay still if we need to continue on?"*



A thud bounced off the walls. Sam and Hannah ran around the elevated gravestone to find Amir flat out spread on the floor.

Amir lifted his head enough to let a "OuhmmMmm" out as a formal complaint.



*"Are you alright?"* - asked Hannah, trying to lift him up with care.

*"Yeah, I just tried to come down and the rock spun as I stepped on it."* - explained Amir rubbing his nose and blowing some sand out of his nostrils.

Hannah looked behind them, a gravity defying rock floated as a stepping stone to reach the platform.

*"You can step on these?"* - she rhetorically asked

*"Well... not for long. This sand feels a lot less soft when you fall ahead first..."* - continued Amir complaining.

She observed the floating rock for an instant, her brain connecting the dots - *"Maybe we can ask the rocks to stop spinning or moving in the air."*

*"Pfff, you want to ask it what? A rock as a rock!"* - added Amir - *"You can't talk to a **silly** rock like I would to y-ouch!"*

Amir's dialogue was interrupted by a sizeable pebble which landed neatly on his head. The pebble came down with abnormal speed as if it was thrown by someone and something. Hannah observed curiously at the immobile material of the wall.



*"Are you sure they can't hear you?"* - inquisitively asked Hannah without diverting her eyes from the wall.

*"Are you daft?"* - replied Amir - *"of course brainless things can't hear u-ouch!"*



The fragile, probably senile, sandstone wall could not maintain itself from losing one or two pebbles on one imprudent child. It was a biological... erm, mineralogical malfunction that only comes with age of standing on the same spot for aeons.



*"I gotta try this!"* - said Hannah with a smirk on her face. She turned to face the floating rock, took a deep breath and said - *"Stay still!"*



Nothing happened.



*"See? I told you!"* - reproachably said Amir - *"These are not living things! Are just stupi-ouch-Ouch-OUCH!"*



Sam saw Amir rubbing his head, on which five red spots could be clearly seen and five pebbles around Amir confirmed the source of the colouration. He then understood what Hannah was trying to achieve and stepped away from Amir as he feared the accidental pebble dislodgement might not be accidental after all.

*"Perhaps there is a nicer way to say it?"* - added Sam.

*"YES!"* - said Hannah excitedly. Her voice echoed through the corridor.

*"I forgot about it Sam"* - she added and facing the stone once more she said - *"Please, could you stand still?"*



The spinning rock softly came to a halt. The children observed the rock for an instance.

*"Holy crab! It worked!"* - said an astonished Amir - *"How did it work? These are just mindless roc-OUCH!"*

*"Amir, you are as dense as a ro..."* - Sam stopped himself from completing the sentence. A pebble stared back at him in defiance - *"As dense as... you are very dense Amir."*



Hannah and Sam decided to explain to Amir, out of fear of losing a companion due to multiple blunt concussions, that it was not wise to speak ill of their surroundings.



*"What now?"* - added Amir, still rubbing his head.

*"Well, this is a dead end. We looked around the corner the path just stops"* - said Sam, helpfully stating what the other two already knew.

*"We might need to go back where there is a gap"* - said Hannah - *"at least there we could see more path to follow."*

*"What if we fall?"* - asked Sam doubtfully.

She didn't answer. That was a question she didn't want to find an answer to.



They walked in silence as they approached the gap.

*"Please, could you stand still?"* - pleaded Hannah.

The boulders obeyed and arranged itself  as a ladder for the children to go by.

Sam looked apprehensively to the blackness below - *"(gulp)"* - the loud noise of his throat made Hannah look at him for an instant. The moment was interrupted as a blurred version of Amir went past and hopped on the boulders reaching the edge of the other side of the corridor in just three large steps.

*Maybe he is part goat* - thought Sam.

Hannah followed. She carefully tested the rigidity of each bounder as the set foot on each. The last stretched was easier for her, Amir waited with his arms open to receive her.

Sam felt his stomach clenching. He stepped back a metre or two, pausing to get more air in his lungs and launched forward running at full speed.

*"What is he doing? You don't need to sprint!"* - said Amir.

Sam jumped, landing on the first boulder. His steps skidded as the loose sand gave out as his feet tried to gain some friction. Sam jumped at the last moment before falling towards the second boulder, the story repeated itself. His feet lost the grip required to stop on the second boulder, his arms swayed uncontrollably in an attempt to gain balance and a new jump was made towards the third boulder.

The third landing, if that could be called landing, consisted on Sam landing with one foot sidewise and the other leg up in the air. By now, he was doing a great impression of a man at a circus, walking the loose rope and about to fall. Pain shooting up from his ankle told him, gravity was sure to win and he just extended his arms forward as he closed his eyes waiting for the worst to happen.

*"I got you buddy!"* - said Amir as he laid on the floor of the corridor holding Sam's hands. Sam swung gently. A few pebbles dislodged by the sudden set of movements, fell into the void. As these venture deeper into the unknown, these exploded into fine particles as a ball of sand would do when you hit it with a hammer.

*"Don't let go!"* - said Sam, terror filling every gap of the sentence.

Hannah grabbed Amir's waist, signalling to him that will were going to pull Sam up to the count of three. The pulled him up, leaving him panting on the floor with his eyes closed.

*This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real* - he thought repeatedly to himself.

*"Sam, are you ok?"* - Hannah asked tentatively to Sam as he recovered the pacing of his breathing.

*"Yes... fine... sorry about that"* - he added a little self absorbed on what could have happened if Amir wouldn't have catch him - *"Let's continue, ok?"*



The trio stood up and walked down the corridor. The corridor ended on a gate with a series of glowing dots resembling the shepherd's crook constellation. The crook glowed with an eery pale blue light.

*"Father's constellation"* - said Hannah, recognising the pattern.

*"Wait! Do you have a father?"* - answered Amir with a hint if anxiety in his voice as he tried to get his messy hair back in a presentable form.

*"Not my father, everybody's father"* - she replied in an attempt to clarify, though it backfired as she noticed Amir distancing from her - *"Father is the name of one of the elders."*

*"Ah, phew!"* - said Amir relieved - *"You got me there for a sec!"*



Sam ignored part of the conversation, mesmerised by the composition and texture on the gate. The eight dots connected by lines drawing the shepherd's crook were made of quartz tightly compacted into gems with an inner glow giving off the vibe that little stars were captured in it. The grain of the gate was different to the walls, whilst the walls had a roughness to it, the gate was perfectly smooth.



*"What does it say down there?"* - asked Hannah pointing to some engraving below Sam's hand. Sam felt the engraving wasn't there just an instant ago.



```
A warrior found two shepherds making bread, one of them had three loaves and the other, five loaves. They agree to share the food. 
After they had eaten, the warrior gave eight gems as a payment for his meal.
How should the shepherds fairly divide the the payment?
```



They all read the message, it required some thinking. Sam felt his brain wasn't right to solve this and looked optimistically to Amir.

Amir read once more the engraving. He seemed deep in thoughts solving complex equations. He finally said - *"Who's the better baker?"*

*"What?"* - replied Hannah thrown off by the impromptu comment - *"Why does that matter?"*

*"Well, I don't know you, but, I wouldn't pay good money for bad bread"* - replied Amir - *"What if the other shepherd had five loaves because he is a bad cook and no-one wants to eat that bread? I just think it is suspicious they have so much bread laying around."*

Hannah observed him in disbelief, opening and closing her mouth trying to make an argument to his reply. Finally, she exhaled as to letting a bad memory go and said - *"The answer should be, the first shepherd should receive one gem, the other seven."*

The glowing crook changed colour to a warm golden light as the gate swung open.

*"How did you know?"* - asked Sam, impressed by Hannah's wit.

*"If they all ate the same amount, the first Shepard had to give one-third of one of his loaves, the other shepherd had to give two loaves and one-third to the warrior. Two loaves equals six-thirds. One vs Seven."* - she explained rationally as she walked past the gate and started observing the changes on the new corridor.

*"... seven gems for bread nobody wanted to eat. What a rip off! What a rip off!"* - lamented Amir shaking his head. Hannah ignored him.

The gate closed behind them, the glowing stars slowly faded away leaving the glassy shape behind.

*"I guess this is one-way only"* - remarked Hannah.



Hannah gaze ran through all the features of the new environment. The corridor wasn't that much different to the previous corridor. Perhaps, it was less tidy as she could notice a lot more debris laying on the floor and it seemed to have some tilt added to it. She started walking absent-mindedly trying to figure out the challenge this new area was going to present. Sam followed her minding his step as the loose sand made him skid after just two steps.



*"... Quality over quantity, you know? That's what I am saying. I am sure that little bit a bread was so much better than... oi!"* - continued Amir lost in his internal dialogue, when he noticed his companions a fair way down the corridor.

Amir rushed to catch up with his friends - *"Oi! Wait for me! Woah-oh-oh-waaaaah!"* - but the loose sand made him fall and slowly but surely he gained speed as the ground became more tilted.

First he bumped into Sam, who also lost his balance and became part of the rolling mass of children slipping down the narrow way. Then the commotion of legs reached Hannah, who involuntarily joined them as they descended out of control.

*"Hold onto anything!"* - she yelled - *"... No! Amir, do not hold onto me!"*

Sam reached out with his hands in an attempt to slow down. It didn't work. Every rock they bumped into got dislodged and burst into powder - *"I can't!"*

*"I wished we had a pick"* - yelled Hannah - *"Anything I could grab on!"*

As if commanded, the sand rolling with them clumped together and anchored itself on the ground as Hannah's free hand went past. The children had come to a stop just a few metres away from the edge of the corridor which would have resulted on all three falling to the abyss below.

The children remained on the floor, panting for an instant.

As Hannah recovered from the recent fright she felt anger brewing, losing her temper - *"Why do you take everything as a joke? If it wasn't for Sam I would still be listening to you and your blue foot. How did you help now with the riddle? I am trying my best to not be dead-weight. What are you doing?"*

The words echoed a few seconds followed by silence.

Sam was covering his mouth with his hands, he could see Hannah slowly regretting her statement just now, but, she looked like the proud-kind. Amir was dead silent.

Hannah stood up, shook her clothes clean, once again to no effect, and walked away quietly.

Sam reached to his friend and wrap him with one arm - *"Ignore her. She is just upset right now because we fell and in not time she will be..."*

*"She's right. I've done nothing."* - interrupted Amir, his voice filled with sorrow.

Sam tried to argue the current low-spirited Amir - *"That's not true! Bud, you saved me back there and you have found some of the..."*

*"I'm sorry I disappointed you."* - interrupted Amir once more. Words were not reaching him.

Sam remained speechless, unsure on the right words to say. He looked at his friend unable to break the gloom state he was in. Amir finally stood up, a quietly walked in the same direction Hannah had disappeared. Sam followed him.

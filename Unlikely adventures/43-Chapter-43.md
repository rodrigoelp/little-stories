# Relaxation time

Theresa finally lands on the islands, exhausted of togging Mathias along. Mathias, as usual, keep saying he shouldn't be around there as the environment doesn't look inviting enough. Theresa mocks Mathias by describing the paradise around them, with Mantas jumping out of the water and engaging in flying, thousands birds flying around, chirping and calling as well as the abundance of places to rest.

Paul appears from one of the caves and laughs, he calls Mathias 'Ishmael' telling him how good of a player he is. Before Mathias could say anything else, Sunny appears with Ishmail, welcoming them to the islands.

Mathias tries to flee the scene, but Paul and Theresa manage to keep him ground despite the Ishmael comment about his brother decided to reject him due to his personal preferences. Mathias, in between teeth, says the reason he didn't like it in there was became sunny ‘stole’ his brother.

Before the situation becomes intense, Amelia shows up and pulls Mathias away, telling him he is too tense and needs to loosen up, dragging him towards a geyser nearby. The sound of an improvised jacuzzi sounds great to which Paul began to run removing his garments along the way, running butt naked towards the geyser. Sunny slaps Ishmael on his head to snap him off his staring session, tells him it would be unwise to have lustful eyes for Paul. Ishmael asks him if that was a jealous warning. Sunny looks at Theresa and tells Ishmael: it is a survival advice.

Theresa and Tracy disappear towards a private place and to enjoy a bath.

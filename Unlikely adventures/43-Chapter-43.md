# Alleviated fatigue

Annoyed and exhausted, Theresa found herself near the limits of her patience with Mathias. She resented every hour since Paul left her behind caring for such an uncoordinated individual.

She thoughtfully reviewed that last idea, Mathias' uncoordinated movements were unusually uncoordinated. The sway of his wings was arrhythmical, producing more drag than lift or propulsion.

It was like watching a teenager with strong preferences for death metal trying to learn to dance salsa with the heavy smoker aunty that smooches you in public, regardless of the social group around you, usually your classmates.

If Theresa had the strength to tug him along, she would have done so a long time ago, like a parent would to a child who doesn't want to leave the most amazing toy shop - *"I sweat Mat, if you flew any slower I wouldn't even be able to describe it?"*

*"Don't know... we could always fly back to Dawn."*

*"No!"* - Theresa had fought Mathias to move along that the thought of him turning back made the nerves on her back ache - *"I just had the general wonderment if we could, perhaps, be a teeny tiny wee more energetic to shorten our travel time."*

Theresa wished Paul to be around. He, for the most parts, was her support; he knew quite well when she had reached the maximum level of social interaction to intervene and give her the necessary breathing room. However, she remembered the negative impact Paul's inexhaustible energy had on Mathias, which is the primary reason why she kindly suggested for Paul to scout ahead to tell her how much longer they had to arrive to the islands.

*"I would appreciate if we stop to rest for a little while."*

*"No Matt, we have rested enough"* - Theresa had to bite her lips to prevent certain decorative words to be added to the sentence. The kind of words once said would cause the elderly around to gasp, the middle aged to cover the ears of children around, and writers to replace the words with a series of dashes.

*"Besides, we should be close to the archipelago"* - she sharpened her sight and flapped a few times to push herself out of the way of two clouds placidly obfuscating the view below - *"What did I tell you? There! There is the main island!"* - The sight infused energy into her tired thoughts.

Sanctuary's archipelago, was a beautiful group of evergreen-grass covered islands, mostly formed by the tender rubbing of tectonic plates known as volcanism; though to all practical effects, nobody thought of the islands as a chain of lava spewing volcanos, instead they were a paradisiac view of sand coloured beaches, crystal clear waters and marvellous thermal ponds in which the edgiest of the characters could be tamed until you sang to the lyrics of the lack of tears when female companionship was nowhere to be found, usually shorted to four succinct words 'Won't cry without woman'. Perhaps the author of the lyrics could restructure it to make it catchier.

The majority of the islands were reasonably sized, larger than the traditional sandbank, that is if you ignored the oddly shaped geyser decorating it in its middle with its little patch of grass around it. Each of the smaller islands sat firmly in place with rings of coral reefs preventing sea currents from washing it away.

The exception to all this incoherent harmony was the main island at the centre of the formation.

It was large and tall enough to be called a fjord with its top split in half by a spring emerging from within the rock, flowing down through a series of waterfalls right into a lake that disappeared into one of the many remaining lava tubes, left behind from the days of the volcano expressed its temperamental personality.

Theresa couldn't hide her thrilled excitement; yes, to the point of sounding redundant.

On the other hand, Mathias looked utterly and unforgivingly sickened.

*"Everything alright?"* - Theresa wondered if she had pushed the poor Mathias past the point of exhaustion.

*"I don't know... Is it too late to bail out?"* - he asked somewhat hopeful, daydreaming about the unlikely event of not having to land on the islands. It didn't last long, Theresa closed her hand on his arm and with unnatural strength she pulled him towards the ground in free fall - *"Wait! Theresa! Let's talk about this!"*

*"Sure! We'll talk on one of the thermal pools!"*

*"That's not what I meant!"*

They spiralled down towards the solid ground of the main island. They tumbled and spun ever faster, it disoriented Mathias; he thought they were out of control, or at least it felt out of control. The sensation of the tight grip told him that Theresa had no intention to let him escape.

The distance to the ground vanished in mere seconds. The rhetorical, ‘In the blink of an eye’ felt to Mathias quiet literal when his feet touched the ground.

*"Ow-weee! The grass is so soft in here!"* - Theresa wasn't displaying the mature, cultured and elegant posture Mathias had known since he joined their group on the outskirts of the wastelands - *"What should I do first!? Shall I dive in the sea? Or wash my back under the waterfall, apply a mud mask, enjoy the thermal ponds..."*

*"Hopefully, not all at once, right?"* - joked Mathias, it was received with an awkward silence.

It was those sorts of situations in which Mathias remembered Paul telling him that it is better to remain ‘quiet and pretty’ than ‘loud and stupid’. Mathias had been grasping the the meaning of it through experimentation.

Theresa's mean look was quickly dismissed as she focused it on the clear water of the lake behind Mathias, leaving him behind. Mathias felt somewhat offended, he felt immaterial.

Instinctively, Mathias followed Theresa.

*The grass feels soft indeed* - he thought. The softness connected to the conditions you need to experience, as a blade of glass, to grow that sleek; perhaps the sporadic volcanic ash, a couple of eggs and maybe rinse it with some papaya. That last thought made him remember of a person washing his hair using that same treatment - *Oh Great! I don't have a plan to deal with my brother.*

Mathias wasn't trapped in his thoughts for long as Paul laughter brought him back to the present. Paul seemed mesmerised at Mathias' presence - *"Haha, the imitation of your brother is out of this world, Issy. You even copied his wings!"*

*"Paul, I am not Ishmael"* - Mathias felt annoyed. It was the sort of annoyance that brews over time when every single family member has got you confused with your brother, not taking into account your best friend, and a girlfriend.

Mathias' comments drowned in Paul's unstoppable laughter - *"Buwahaha! Even your nostrils are wide open, and you're grinding your teeth! Just like Matt!"*

Mathias' nostrils opened even wider with anger rushing to his head - *"Paul! I'm Matt!"*

*"But look whos here! If it isn't Mateo!"* - Mathias felt goosebumps listening Sunny's voice; like a cat who has walked straight into a dingo conservation centre on bath day - *"Ay Issy! Come outside, jor brother is here! Tis is a matter of celebration!"*

Mathias felt queasy knowing his brother was about to show up. Maybe queasy doesn't describe properly his feelings, he had the same reaction you get after reading the label of a strawberry yogurt, just to find out it was a powerful laxative.

*"Hey Sunny, I was just passing thought and guess what? We don't have to stir things up, I was about to leave..."* - Mathias attempted to escape, but Paul blocked his departure.

If Paul's grip wasn't bad enough, Theresa wrapped his right arm around his neck, it hurt. She had a big grin, letting him know the hug could be a lot more painful - *"You guys are family. There is always time for family, right?"*

*"... Theresa, I think I heard my neck crack..."* - Mathias' voice had a smidge of irritation barely noticeable. Unfortunately for Mathias, Theresa was the kind of person that can pick up the otherwise imperceptible detail. She squeezed tighter as Mathias wiggled his arm in an attempt to release it.

*"And I imagine you must be the lovely ‘Tere’ Pauly has been talking about."* - Ishmael emerged from behind Sunny, he inspected his brother from top to bottom. It was like watching himself in the mirror, if your reflection appeared to have the strong need to rush to the toilet after having spoiled seafood - *"But I believe if others are uncomfortable they should be able to leave, my dear lady. My brother finds certain disdain for my personal preferences and flamboyant personality."*

*"It is not you the one I have problems with, but that thief..."* - mumbled Mathias fixated on Ishmael's feet, almost as if he felt ashamed with being unable to stare into his brother's eyes. The butchered words didn't travel that far, but Theresa had an exceptional hearing and keen sense of timing. She let Mathias go.

*"What did you say dear brother?"* - Ishmael cupped his hand around his ear, it always irritated Mathias, you could tell, he would have been able to breathe in a small bird with his wide nostrils.

*"Matt!?!"* - Amelia's excitement was clear as day. A day without clouds, fog or smog, obviously.

*"... Hi Amelia"* - he replied struggling to maintain his balance once Amelia wrapped him up in the tightest hug he has ever received.

*"I am glad so to see you!"*

*"You always see him girl. We are identical"* - snapped Ishmael.

*"Oh wow, feel those shoulders, so stiff! You must be exhausted, huh?"* - Amelia completely ignored Ishmael's nagging comments or Mathias' wide pleading eyes to Paul. She would secure the opportunity to spend time with Mathias - *"Sunny made some amazing changes around here and, I guess you don't care about who made it, right? I want to show you the pool at the back! Sunny made it so the warm water of the hot spring mixes with fizzy rocks, it is the most amazing experience. He called it Jazz-oozy"*

*"Oh jes, a truly formidable peas of engineering, if I may say so myself."* - Sunny felt proud of his achievement, it wasn't an everyday occurrence when you managed to channel the rich mineral water of the spring down a series of pipes, mostly made of bamboo, making the most relaxing and enjoyable room to workout your muscles.

*"Why is it called jazz-oozy?"* - asked Mathias resisting Amelia's enthusiastic nudges towards one of the caves.

Sunny smiled wide; his chest filled with pride - *"Well Mateo, jou'll find out soon, as relaxation will ooze in jour muscles like jazz to jour ears. Only time will reveal why I called it like that."*

Ishmael bumped gently his elbow on Sunny's large arms whilst shaking his head. Sunny realised he just gave out the reason.

*"Oi! I want in too! You know?"* - Paul took off some of his garments with blazing speed, feeling his body loosing up already. It was somewhat entertaining to say the least, he ran up the hill limping on one leg whilst struggling with the other, his pants didn't want to let go.

Sunny's well defined arm wrapped around Ishmael's shoulders and squeezed hard enough to snap Ishmael off his trance - *"An innocent look, my dear, that's all it was. Don't let your jealousy fool you, I didn't have lustful eyes."*

*"I know, take tis as a friendly warning. Jou do not want to be found with lustful eyes towards that man."* - Sunny stirred Ishmael's gaze towards the very frightening girl with black wings staring back at him as she walked towards the entrance of the cave, following Paul. Suddenly Ishmael understood: it was all about survival.

Ishmael wrapped one arm around Sunny's shoulders, pulling him towards an empty section of the shore - *"Let's sunbathe around here, would you? I feel I need some time for ourselves."*

The group had split in two, those about to absorb a healthy dose of sunlight and those checking out the jazz oozing capabilities of geo-thermally waters.

From Tracy's perspective, she had to choose between feeling like the third wheel or the fifth, assuming she still remembers how wheels worked. The prospect of being surrounded by couples didn't sound very appealing, so she climbed towards the mountain's top to listen the wind go by.

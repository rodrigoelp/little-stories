# Alleviated fatigue

Annoyed and tired, Theresa found herself near the limits of her patience with Mathias. She resented every hour since Paul left her behind caring for such an uncoordinated individual.

She gave it another thought to that last idea, Mathias had been unusually uncoordinated, moving his wings arrhythmically, he created more drag than lift or propulsion. It was like watching a teenager with strong preference towards music in which the only moving part was bobbing you head, learning to dance salsa with the heavy smoker aunty that smooches you at the first opportunity she noticed one of your classmates as the audience.

If she had the strength to tug him along, she would have done it a long time ago, like a child who doesn't want to leave the most amazing toy shop - *"I sweat Mat, if you flew any slower I wouldn't even be able to describe it?"*

*"Don't know... we could always fly back."*

*"No!"* - Theresa had fought so long for Mathias to move along that the thought of him turning back made the nerves on her back ache - *"I just had the general wonderment if we could, perhaps, be a teeny tiny wee more energetic to shorten our travel time."*

Theresa wished Paul to be around. He, for the most parts, was her support; he knew quite well when she had reached the maximum level of social interaction to intervene and give her the necessary breathing room. However, she remembered the negative impact Paul's inexhaustible energy had on Mathias, which is the primary reason why she kindly suggested for Paul to scout ahead how long they had to fly.

*"I would appreciate if we stop to rest for a little while."*

*"No Matt, we have rested enough"* - Theresa had to bite her lips to prevent certain decorative words to be added to the sentence. The kind of words once said would cause the elderly around to gasp, the middle aged to cover the ears of children around, and writers to replace the words with a series of dashes.

*"Besides, we should be close to the Islands."* - she sharpened her sight and flapped a few times to push herself out of the way of two clouds placidly obfuscating the view below - *"What did I tell you? There! There is the archipelago!"* - The sight infused energy into her tired thoughts.

Sanctuary's archipelago, was a beautiful group of evergreen-grass covered islands, mostly formed by the tender rubbing of tectonic plates known as volcanism; though to all practical effects, nobody thought of the islands as a chain of lava spewing volcanos, instead they were a paradisiac view of sand coloured beaches, crystal clear waters and marvellous thermal ponds in which the edgiest of the characters could be tamed until you sang to the lyrics of the lack of tears when female companionship was nowhere to be found, usually shorted to four succinct words.

The majority of the islands were reasonably sized to be called sandbanks, that is if you ignored the oddly shaped geyser decorating it in its middle with its little patch of grass around it. Each of the smaller islands sat firmly in place with rings of coral reefs preventing sea currents from washing it away.

The exception to all this incoherent harmony was the main island at the centre of the formation. It was large and tall enough to be called a fjord with its top split in half by a spring emerging from within the rock, flowing down through a series of waterfalls right into a lake that disappeared into one of the many remaining lava tubes, left behind from the days of the volcano  expressed its moody character.

Theresa couldn't hide her thrilled excitement; yes, to the point of sounding redundant.

On the other hand, Mathias looked utterly and unforgivingly sick.

*"Everything alright there?"* - Theresa wondered if she had pushed the poor Mathias past the point of exhaustion.

*"I don't know... Is it too late to bail out?"* - he asked somewhat hopeful, daydreaming about the unlikely event of not having to land on the islands. It didn't last long, Theresa closed her hand on his arm and with unnatural strength she pulled him towards the ground in free fall - *"Wait! Theresa! Let's talk about this!"*

*"Sure! We'll talk on one of the thermal pools!"*

*"That's not what I meant!"*

They spiralled down towards the solid ground of the main island. They tumbled and spun ever faster than before, it disoriented Mathias; he thought they were out of control, or at least it felt out of control. The sensation of the tight grip told him that Theresa had no intention to let him escape.

The distance to the ground vanished in mere moments. The rhetorical, ‘In the blink of an eye’ felt to Mathias quiet literal when his feet touched the ground.

*"Ow-weee! The grass is so soft in here!"* - Theresa wasn't displaying the mature, cultured and elegant posture Mathias had known since he joined their group on the outskirts of the wastelands - *"What should I do first!? Shall I dive in the sea? Or wash my back under the waterfall, apply a mud mask, enjoy the thermal ponds..."*

*"Hopefully, not all at once, right?"* - joked Mathias, it met an awkward silence. It was those sorts of situations in which Mathias remembered Paul telling him that it is better to remain ‘quiet and pretty’ than ‘loud and stupid’. Mathias had been grasping the the meaning of it through experimentation.

Theresa's mean look was quickly dismissed as she focused it on the clear water of the lake behind Mathias, leaving him behind. Mathias felt somewhat offended, he felt immaterial.

Instinctively, Mathias followed Theresa - *the grass is very soft indeed* - he thought. The softness connected to the conditions you need to experience, as a blade of glass, to grow that sleek; perhaps the sporadic volcanic ash, a couple of eggs and maybe rinse it with some papaya. That last thought made him remember of a person washing his hair using that same treatment - *Oh Great! I came here without a plan or a topic of conversation to deal with my brother.*

Paul laughter brought Mathias back into the present. Paul walked towards Mathias - *"Haha, your imitation of your brother is out of this world, Issy. You even copied his wings!"*

*"Paul, I am not Ishmael"* - replied Mathias feeling annoyed. It was the sort of annoyance you get with every single family member who has got you confused with your brother, not taking into account your best friend and a girlfriend.

Mathias' comments drowned in Paul's unstoppable laughter - *"Buwahaha! Your nostrils are wide open and you are even grinding your teeth exactly like Matt!"*

Mathias nostrils opened even wider as he felt anger rushing to his head - *"Paul! I'm Matt!"*

*"But look whos here! If it isn't Mateo!"* - Sunny's voice made Mathias feel goosebumps; like a cat who has walked straight into a dingo conservation centre - *"Ay Issy! Come outside, jor brother is here!"*

The mention of his brother's name had a very different effect to the previous emotions. Mathia experienced the same awkwardness you get when you ate all the strawberry yogurt on the first tray of your mom's fridge, but she casually drops the comment she is unable to find the glass of laxatives she prepared with strawberries since you arrived.

*"Oh, hi Sunny... I was just passing thought and guess what? Is that the time? I should continue my way"* - Mathias spread his wings, but he wasn't fast enough, Paul reached out to block his departure.

Mathias panicked, just about to protest when a strong female arm, partially covered with her black wings, wrapped around his shoulders. She added a big grin letting him know the half hug could turn into a painful double wrist lock - *"You guys are family. There is always time for family, right?"*

*"... Theresa, could you let me go?"* - Mathias' voice had a smidge of irritation barely noticeable. Unfortunately for Mathias, Theresa was the kind of person that can pick up the otherwise imperceptible detail. She squeezed tighter as Mathias wiggled his arm in an attempt to release it.

*"And I imagine you must be the lovely ‘Tere’ Pauly has been talking about."* - said Ishmael whilst he inspected his brother. It was like watching himself in the mirror, if your reflection appeared to have the strong need to rush to the toilet after having spoiled seafood - *"But, as much as it pains me, you should let him go, dear lady. My brother finds certain disdain for my personal preferences and flamboyant behaviour."*

*"It is not you the one I have problems with, but that thief..."* - mumbled Mathias fixated on Ishmael's feet, almost as if he felt ashamed with being unable to stare into his brother's eyes. The butchered words didn't travel that far, but Theresa had an exceptional hearing and keen sense of timing. She let Mathias go.

*"What did you say dear brother?"* - Ishmael cupped his hand around his ear, it was the sort of action Mathias found extremely irritating. Mathias nostrils widened further more.

*"Matt!?!"* - heard Mathias, he remembered that voice, it was the voice of someone who tends to wrap their arms around your neck before you could say hi.

*"... Hi Amelia"* - he replied struggling to maintain his balance once Amelia wrapped him in the tightest hug he has ever received.

*"I am glad to see you again!"*

*"You always see him girl. We are identical"* - said Ishmael irritated.

*"You must be so tired Matt, I feel it on your shoulders, so stiff!"* - Amelia completely ignored Ishmael's nagging comments or Mathias' wide pleading eyes to Paul. She wasn't going to let the opportunity go away - *"Sunny made some amazing changes around here and, I guess you don't care about who made it, right? I want to show you a pond at the back! Sunny made it so the warm water of a nearby geyser mixes with fizzy rocks, it is the most amazing experience. He called it Jazz-oozy"*

*"Oh jes, a truly formidable peas of engineering, if I may say so myself."* - Sunny felt proud of his achievement, it wasn't an everyday occurrence you managed to channel through a series of pipes made out of bamboo, filtered heavily mineral water for the enjoyment and relaxation of your muscles.

*"Why is it called jazz-oozy?"* - asked Mathias resisting Amelia's enthusiastic nudges towards one of the caves.

Sunny smiled wide; his chest filled with pride - *"Well Mateo, jou'll find out soon, as relaxation will ooze in jour muscles like jazz to jour ears. Only time will reveal why I called it like that."*

Ishmael bumped gently his elbow on Sunny's large arms whilst shaking his head. Sunny realised he just gave out the reason.

*"Oi! I want in too! You know?"* - Paul took off some of his garments with blazing speed, feeling his body loosing up already. It was somewhat entertaining to say the least, he ran up the hill limping on one leg whilst struggling with the other, his pants didn't want to let go.

Sunny's well defined arm wrapped around Ishmael's shoulders and squeezed strong enough to snap Ishmael off his trance - *"An innocent look, my dear, that's all it was. Don't let your jealousy fool you, I didn't have lustful eyes."*

*"I know, take this as a friendly warning. Jou do not want to be found with lustful eyes towards that man."* - Sunny stirred Ishmael's gaze, until Ishmael found himself watching a very frightening girl with black wings staring back at him as she walked towards the entrance of the cave, following Paul. Suddenly Ishmael understood: it was all about survival.

Ishmael nodded with a friendly smile. He wrapped one arm around Sunny's shoulders, pulling him towards an empty section of the shore - *"Let's sunbathe around here, would you? I feel I need some time for ourselves."*

The group had split in two groups, those about to absorb a healthy dose of sunlight and those checking out the jazz oozing capabilities of geo-thermally waters. She had to choose between feeling a third wheel or a fifth, assuming she still remembers how wheels worked. The prospect of both didn't sound as appealing to the various groups, so she decided to fly up towards the mountain top to listen the wind go by.

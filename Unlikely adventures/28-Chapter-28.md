# Echoes in the wind

Sam felt his stomach filled with one million butterflies flapping their wings in unison, or perhaps the sensation of a rope twirling in his belly with the rope quickly evaporating into thin air; it was the sensation of falling through nothingness. He wanted to scream, kick or fight but the chiropteran figure secured its long fingers around him, preventing any voluntary or involuntary movement. He clenched is fists, as a sign of protest to the creature keeping him hostage. The sensation of falling stopped abruptly with the thud his body made landing on the ground covered with cobblestones. To his surprise, it was not painful at all, so he opened his eyes to the unpleasant figure of the bat looking down on him - *Stand up boy!*

Sam observed the creature in front of him, it had long thin legs which ended on dark grey claws.

*"WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS?"* - yelled Sam at the top of his lungs. He was not expecting it was going to come that loud, but his voice echoed off structures in this new environment.

*"Sam?"* - said Amir's voice at the distance. Sam struggled with his thoughts, he wanted to find the location of Amir's voice, his fear glued his eyes to the creature facing him.

 *"Sam, are you ok?"* - queried Amir. The tone let Sam know Amir wasn't in immediate danger.

The bat refocused its gaze from something distant to Sam. The bat moved sideways, filled with expectation of what its prey is prepared to do. The leathery wings moved slowly to cover its shape. Sam felt as if the creature grew taller.

*"Are you the spirit of the trial of air?"* - asked Sam, in an attempt to rationalise the later events.

*I think it is obvious I am the guardian, yes.* - said the bat still contemplating the diminished figure of Sam - *I judge those seeking to get the blessing of the air.*

*"Stop doing that and tell us what we should do"* - demanded Sam, throwing away every hint of good manners.

The bat stopped its predatory motion and drilled with its eyes every single feature of Sam's face, one eyebrow raised inquisitively - *What a big mouth you have when you are so little* - said menacingly the bat. Its voice revealed a hint of anger.

*Perhaps I shall terminate this evaluation without giving you an opportunity* - continued the bat as it opened one wing and crossed its neck with its long finger, suggesting Sam's head might become detached very soon.

Sam tried to muster some courage, it was hard to find it when it was completely buried under its bed scared for the bat standing in front of Sam. He tried to remember Yule's words and whispered - *"This is not real. It is not real."*

One side of the Bat's lips curved up revealing a sinister smirk, it was haunting  - *What isn't real, boy? Do you think I am not real? Didn't to feel my grip tighten around your chest a moment ago?* 

The Bat's smirk had turned into a ghastly wide smile; its wings were spread to its maximum length revealing its thin body, covered with a leathery and furry garment, it resembled an aviator shearing jacket; assuming aviation was a thing in this little planet, which it was not - *HA HA HA HA... I think you have run out of luck. I am not just a spirit! I am the ruler of this dreamland, the creator of everything your eyes set upon here, the master of your perception. If your perception says your time is over, you won't wake up on the other side boy! You are my slave now and I... I am your queen! HA HA HA HA*

The laugher echoed of the structures around them, it amplified the spine-chilling sound with million of bat's laughing at the same time. Sam tried to cover his ears but the last few words bounced in his head - *"Wait, did you say Queen?"*

*Yes insolent child! Now bow to me and serve me with your life!* - continued the Bat

Sam looked at the Bat from its thin legs all the way to its horrible fleshy mask - *"I... hums... You are a girl???"*

The question caught the Bat by surprise - *Well... ye.. yes? YES! WHAT DID YOU THINK I AM?* - her expression contorted to pure shock as she felt her femininity put to the test. 

"Not a girl for sure!" - replied Sam unapologetically - "I mean, look at you! You are a monst..."

Sam decided to was best to leave the statement unfinished, the Bat's eye were filled with hatred - *"I... I am sorry, your grace. I guess I was confused by the... ohms... the... wings! Yes, I was confused by the wings as it makes you broad on the shoulders!"*

*I AM NOT BROAD ON THE SHOULDERS, YOU LITTLE PRICK!* - stated the Bat in her rage.

*"Sam! Please stop talking!"* - yelled Hannah who has been following the conversation through the echoes. Sam noticed she sounded as distant as Amir did but, she was on a different location. Hannah continued - *"Apologies on his behalf your majesty! I am Hannah and we seek to earn your blessings."*

The Bat had turned to focus on Hannah a long distance away from them - *Do you think you are worthy of my blessings? Even after this child insulted me?*

*"We are asking for a chance your majesty. My friends lack tact and they are way too young."* - replied Hannah's voice. Sam could almost read Hannah's thoughts - *I am just grateful the spirit with Sam. Amir would have been much worse!*

The Bat seemed to consider Hannah's request for a moment, then gave a hateful look at Sam, spread its wings and flew away towards a direction between Hannah's and Amir's location. At this point, Sam felt he could relax and study the new environment he was in. This new dreamworld consistent on the same black sky above and below them: four islands floated suspended by magical forces keeping things from falling apart; between the islands boulders spun and bobbed against a current of air rushing from an invisible source below them towards the black sky.

Sam noticed the islands resembled a little solar system. The Bat had flown towards the island in the middle whilst the other three islands orbited around like little planets. The effect was maximised as the middle island had a lime coloured flame shining through, the island was voided of any other feature other than the tall Bat shape standing on it.

Sam continued to analyse the rest of the islands, the closest island to the middle had a small child on it, he could recognise Hannah's long hair standing against the wind blowing up. The island seemed to be a clump of dirt, kept together by the roots of a massive dead tree, which branches rose metres above the ground below. From the base of the tree a series of branches formed a staircase of sorts that created a path towards higher altitudes.

Following Hannah's island, Sam could observe Amir jumping between some bounders stacked one of top of the other, sort of like the most dangerous balancing rocks sculpture ever. Amir's island had a quality that made it look very much solid and balanced by invisible forces. Sam watched Amir jumping from one rock to another whilst stretching an arm to climb further up.

Finally, Sam inspected his island, the furthest of the bunch. His island seemed to have more structure, making it feel more fabricated and less natural. The ground was covered with neatly arranged cobblestones and a few benches. In the middle of the island a tower rose tall above the ground, slightly twisted and bent as the tower fought the wind who had a secret against to change the verticality of the tower. As Sam eyes started to descend from the top most location of the tower it followed each feature it had to offer, each arched window carefully decorated with blueish grey stones, missing chunks of wall revealing an intricate set of stairs to finally the base of the tower, on which a crooked iron gate informed the newcomer the gate wouldn't be able to be shut close without proper reconstruction.

*You seek my blessings, you say* - echoed the Bat's voice across the empty space - *But why should I consent such a thought when you have not respect for your elders?*

*"Because it is fair..."* - echoed Amir's voice from his island. The statement felt somewhat uncharacteristic 'Amir' - "Oh, your unattractive majesty!" - Ah, now it felt like a proper 'Amir' commentry.

*... I am not the judge of fairness, you insolent Moth. Perhaps I shall give you death to show you some respect!* - said the Bat. Sam remembered the glistening claws at the end of the thin arms, chills ran down his spine thinking about the possible confrontation.

*"We only request a challenge to prove our worth, your majesty. Every trial so far has reviewed and judged with worth as vessels of its elemental light, we just request a chance to show you that, despite my companions lack of thinking, we are good hearted and capable of your respect. If we fail, you can take our flames!"* - replied Hannah's voice.

*Why shall I concede such privilege?* - echoed the Bat's voice - *I think I would be wasting my time with you lot.*

*"You brought us here for a reason"* - replied Sam feeling the argument was loaded with deceit - *"I would've understand if we triggered anything in the cave and found ourselves here by our own doing but... **you** brought us here."*

Sam's voice echoed through the space, bouncing off the structures, reaching the Bat's ears. It gave it some consideration - *You are insolent and ballsy boy, don't you fear me?*

*"Yeah! So?"* - said Sam.

*Don't you fear I will go there and rip your soul to shreds?* - continued the Bat.

*"I am terrorised of just imagine it!"* - answered Sam.

*Yet, you can't stop your big mouth from getting you further in trouble.* - stated the Bat - *Very well, I challenge you to take the light from my hands. I will wait right here!*

*"But how do we get there?"* - asked Hannah from her little island - *"The islands aren't connected between each other and, as per usual, we don't have our wings!"*

An evil smile appeared on the Bat's face - *Lightness of thoughts. I am amazing by how little creativity you have. You figure it out, it is not my problem!* - replied the Bat as it broke out in maniacal laughter.

*"At least we don't have to see her ugly face from up close!"* - said Amir's voice as it bounced of the structure and reached the Bat's ears.

Her maniacal laughter stopped instantly - *I will make you regret that comment, kid.*

The bat extended three of her thin fingers and stabbed the ground below her with her sharp claws. A black tar-like substance flowed out of the island, shaping up into three dark figures resembling the Bat herself - *I'll add an extra condition to the challenge then. Steal the light before my shadows steal yours!* - the three dark figures opened their wings and jumped towards each of the islands to hunt down the children.

The newly formed creatures had trouble maintaining stable flight, Sam noticed. The wind was strong enough to tear gashes of black leather from their wings, it only worked to slow them down - *"Hannah! Amir! Run! It is coming for us!"* - Sam yelled. 

Hannah's sharp mind reacted immediately to the incoming creature flying towards her; she was not going to wait to find out what the creature could do and she tried to find shelter from the oncoming challenge. Hannah ran towards the first few steps of the staircase made by the branches and climbed up.

*"Is she climbing up? Are you seriously climbing up?"* - commented Amir confused by Hannah's actions - *"The thing flies! It is going to you! It is pointless to go up!"*

*"Yes, it can fly but not very well! Just look at it, it is struggling!"* - replied Hannah carefully timing each step with the subtle movement of the dead tree - *"For now, climb up whilst we think what we should do!"*

Sam paid close attention to the creature arriving Hannah's island, its actions weren't as fluid as the Bat, his gaze moved to Amir who begun hopping from one stone to another. For an instant, Sam wished he had Amir's agility, he moved smoothly from one rock to another as he continued his way towards the middle of the structure.

*Your mind is on the clouds boy!* - said the third copy of the Bat, who had just landed on Sam's island. The creature's sharp claw missed Sam's back by a narrow margin as Sam ducked out of the way and rolled on his back by accident.

*"You talk?"* - said Sam pushing his body away from the creature. His brain had ordered his feet to stand up and run, his feet were a little too scared to reach to the order.

He dragged his hands on the floor, his fingers reacted instinctively to the wiggle a loose cobble did and clenched on it. The tip of his fingers went white due to the pressure of his grip and, as the replica of the bat draw itself near Sam, he threw the cobble bashing the creature straight on its face; the creature became undone on a black puddle on the ground.

Sam took a breath in relief - *"Oh... that was easy"* - he mentioned standing up, doubtfully getting close to the puddle. He stopped as soon as he notice it bubbling. The bubbling became more violent and from the puddle the black replica of the Bat started to take shape.

*"Oh no!"* - he said, sprinting towards the twisted iron gate and onto the staircase.

The creature took a few tentative steps, it was shaken whilst it reformed its muscles and finished its constitution. It walked a little bit more towards the iron gate and checked its claws against the hinges, it cut right through, freeing the heavy gate making a loud bang on contact with the cobbles. The creature smiled and entered the tower, chasing Sam - *It is futile, boy. I don't need to run to get to you. There is no exit at the top of the tower. In time, you will be mine!*

Sam had no idea how far up he had climbed; the voice of the creature echoed inside the tower, giving off the impression the creature was just behind him, making him flinch. Sam reached the first of the gap in the wall, he remembered seeing it about a fifth of its way from the bottom up. His eyes searched of a place he could hide in, every space seemed too small, the tower was just too narrow and it was just filled with the encased staircase. The sound of slimy steps told him the creature was closer than he liked or appreciated, his survival instinct kicked in and so he ran up the swirling staircase.

Initially he galloped as fast as possible but, like anybody else running without a plan, his movements slowed down as his lungs told him there was not enough oxygen for his little flame. He had passed a few windows already and another one picked around the corner. He looked outside and saw Hannah waving from side to side a branch she probably ripped off the tree and engaged her pursuer - *"It doesn't work Hannah! Just run!"* - he yelled.

*Distracted once more kid. Your thoughts weight you down!* - said his creature displaying enormous agility as it stepped on a side of the wall and tried to pounce on Sam.

Luckily for Sam, he managed to dodge the attack and kicked the creature on the back, making it loose balance blocking the path down; perhaps it wasn't as lucky for Sam after all. He turned back to his ascending path and with new found motivation ran some more. A few more arched windows revealed to Sam he had reached the middle of the tower, the sound of sticky steps told him the achievement should be celebrated at some other point, so he ran. Each new step tensed the muscles of his legs, his lower back (also known as Gluteus Maximus) screamed in pain due to exhaustion, somehow his brain had pumped enough adrenaline to keep him ignoring his muscles and lungs.

A long «dong» shook him awake from the trance he dove into - *"Huh? What's that?"* - he asked listening to another «dong» from above.

Sam ran to the next window to check on his companions. The window opened to the Amir's island and he observed, partly with admiration and partly with horror, Amir jumping from one rock to another, kicking the creature along the way, in an attempt to make it fall off the balancing stones -  *"What are you doing?"* - he said to Amir.

*"What does it look like? Fighting back!"* - replied a somewhat tired Amir.

"Are you crazy?" - said Sam, stopping to replay the expression in his head - *"What a silly thing to say, it is Amir, of course he would do that."*

*"Hey!"* - yelled Amir whilst he stepped on the creature forehead to launch himself higher - *"I heard that!"*

*HA! Too slow!* - said the creature behind Sam as it swung its claw in an attempt to cut him to shred. Sam's instincts kicked to avoid a fatal blow, not fast enough to emerge without a scratch, a deep cut on his back showed the unsuccessful dodge. The creature gave off an evil grin, pleased at the sight of Sam on the floor, raised its arm in preparation to finish off the job - *I guess, you won't make it out of this trial.* 

A loud «dong» echoed through the tower. Sam felt the reverberation travelling into his body, shaking his insides but, he ignored it, he focused on the creature's reaction to the sound. It covered its ears and screeched in pain with each «dong». Sam took the opportunity to flee its presence and its reach, stood up and continued the ascension towards the source of the periodic sound - *If I reach the source of the sound it might stop it!* - he thought.

Sam had grown used to dismiss the screams of pain as his muscles complained about the extreme effort he had put them through, the world had become a blur of stonewalls, steps he has left behind and arched windows revealing a black sky and some other islands outside. The fresh air made him refocus on the here and now, Sam observed a new gap in the wall. From it he could see his friends in a losing battle: Hannah dragged herself up with her pursuer in close proximity, Amir limped on one leg a few metres above his pursuer. Sam didn't have time to check on them, he grabbed a metallic rod stuck on the side of the wall. He pulled and swivelled it until it popped out of its socket. 

*The rod might come handy if the creature comes close* - he thought and he continued running towards the very top of the tower, swaying the rod maniacally above his head.

«Dong!» - the sound was crisp and clear. Sam knew he was seconds away from the source - «Dong!» - the sound was louder and he could see on the walls the flicker twisted after glow the light leaves after it is reflected off a metallic surface. The freshness in the air energised him, revealing his proximity to the end of the staircase.

Sam stepped out of the staircase at the top of the tower, into a space covered by rubble left behind when the roof of the tower gave up. However, the tower was crowed by a large green bell suspended of a metal rod swivelling with the wind - «Dong!»

Sam smiled and ran to the edge of the tower to inspect the design of Amir's and Hannah's respective 'towers'. The tree had a set of many smaller bells, chiming to the rhythm of the wind. The balancing rocks had a reversed bell, balancing itself precariously on what it would be its hinge. Sam browsed the balancing stones in an attempt to find Amir - *"Guys! At the top there are bells! Those things can't stand the sound of the bells!"*

Amir's voice did not reply Sam's enquiry, he couldn't find him jumping or hopping on the rocks as he tried to escape the creature - *"Amir?"* - queried Sam in an attempt to locate his friend. The question was interrupted by Hannah screams - *"Let go of me!"*

Sam gaze swiftly went to the tree island. On there he saw in horror that Hannah was pinned to the trunk of the tree by her ghastly pursuer's claw. Instinctively, he crouched and picked a rock laying around and threw it in an attempt to hit the creature, not that he would have been able, he was too far away. Instead, Sam watched the rock come to a halt as it spun suspended mid air by the wind currents which prevented its expected trajectory down.

*"Hannah! I'm com-mhooph!"* - tried to phrase Sam as his face shifted forcefully to a different location.

*Silly boy* - said Sam's pursuer, retracting its long arm back after hitting Sam with force, throwing him a fair distance from the edge. The impact made Sam release whatever he was holding and sent him tumbling on the floor - *Did you think you could get away from me? You shall learn a lesson to respect your elders and obey orders!*

«Dong!» - rang the bell again loudly, giving to Sam's a necessary relief to escape the reach of the creature screeching in pain. Sam searched for the rod he was carrying and jumped on it as soon as he could and sought shelter behind the bell. The creature inspected the world around it in an attempt to find Sam amount the rubble on the roof and the bell. There he had an idea - *Why wait for the bell to ring with the wind?*

Sam's grip tighten on the rod and before having a swing at the bell with his rod he did the common silly action everybody does before a loud noise, he closed his eyes - «DONG!»

Sam heard the creature squeal and shriek louder than before. He had another swing at the bell - «DONG!»

The creature fought to maintain its balance whilst it covered its sensitive ears - *Stop it!* - it said. Sam swung his rod once more - «DONG!»

Even the sound was hurting Sam's ears but, the creature seemed to be backing away, towards the stairs. Sam took the biggest swing yet at the bell - «DOOONG!»

The creature stepped back further more and tripped down the stairs disappearing from view. Sam raised his rod once more in anticipation of the emergence of the creature, yet he was caught by surprise when a «Crack» followed by a loud «Dong!» made him step back and watch in horror as the base of the bell crumbled under the weight of the bell swivelling furiously from side to side. The base gave up and shattered into several pieces expelled in all directions, the bell dropped heavily on the floor producing one distorted ring «BUH-GANG-PONG!»

The floor shook violently and deep grooves appeared on the it, several stones disappeared from view as these fell down; the tower was collapsing under its weight. Sam tried to remain vertical, but the rocking motion and the increasing tilting of the floor pushed him onto his knees, in a few seconds Sam was going to find out what laid deep in the void below him.

Bounders and stones began sliding towards the side the tower was falling into. Sam hopped back on his feet and dodged a few of these. Large gaps were choking, swallowing all the rubble that littered once the tower's top, but, in just a few more seconds, that problem had stopped as the debris fell sideways to Sam. He just closed his eyes expecting the worst. He felt his feet leaving the vertical ground, a few stones, splinters of wood, nails or metal hit him on various places as he tumbled above the void. The air howled furiously on his ears and there he waited for a few instants before trying to check the horrors in which he must have been fallen into - *I am sorry guys, I couldn't do anything to help* - he thought before taking a deep breath, in an attempt to gain courage and slowly opened one eye, a lonely stone spun our of control a few centimetres away from him, behind it his island was crumbling away, eroded by the wind pushing up.

*Am I flying?* - he thought whilst checking his back to gain understanding. His wings have not returned so he decided to look down - *Huh, I am falling... but the wind is pushing me faster than what I fall!*

Hannah screamed once more, it was filled with anguish and pain. Sam turned to find the source of Hannah's voice, instead his gaze travelled through the balancing stones and he saw Amir's inert body, hung by its neck by his creature - *"NO!"* - screamed Sam.

*Oh Yes!* - replied the creature holding Amir's body. - *One down, two to go!* - said the creature releasing Amir's body on the ground.

Sam watched the body intently, expecting any movement. There was nothing. It was a surreal stream of events watching Amir's body totally still. Something broke inside of Sam, he couldn't listen the rage of the wind maintaining him floating despite the effects of gravity, he could not feel the million pieces bumping onto him as it drifted in the current. All Sam could feel was pressure building up in his head, a tribal «thump pump, thump pump» absorbing every aspect of his life, the feeling of his guts being squeezed out of his belly. It was the first time every Sam felt rage taking over him, a red mist of sorts.

Sam pushed himself a few times from boulders and stones floating around him, gaining enough force to push a large chuck of the ex-tower towards the balancing stones. It didn't take long before the beautiful structure came down once the debris bounced of its base. A cloud of dust swallow Amir's body and his attacker. Sam wanted the watch the world end.

A glimpse of reason zipped through Sam's mind, he remembered about Hannah so he pushed a boulder behind him to gain speed towards Hannah's island, he wanted to yelled to the wind all sorts of things, non of them polite in the presence of little children, moderately educated adults or seniors of any age. He just wanted to disembowel the responsive for this but first, he needed to rescue Hannah.

*"Sam!"* - yelled Hannah - *"Do not come close!... Save... yourself!"* - she added before her eyes rolled to white. The smiling face of her pursuer rose behind her, its claws emerged from Hannah's stomach as she collapsed on the branches below. A Sam streak flashed through the branches taking the smiling creature with him - *"I'll make you pay!"*

The creature felt Sam's tight grip and murderous intent - *You shall talk to my master then!* - and its almost solid shape became undone into a goo dispelled by the wind.

Sam moved his arms to adjust his trajectory towards the Bat, who stood watching the resolution of the entire event. If Sam had blood, he would be feeling it boiling, there was no fear in his heart any more, just hate and rage. A final turn and twist deposited Sam a few metres away from the imposing figure of the Bat.

*Excellent, for once you are not overthinking at all...* - stated the Bat.

*"Shut up! I am tired of your stupid game. I just need to wait for my friends to come back and we will take the light."* - added Sam.

*Come back from where?* - said the Bat.

*"We came back when the spider captured us, or when I drowned in water. I know this is not real!"* - said Sam.

*An interesting way of thinking dear boy.* - replied the Bat - *But, words by themselves aren't a real thing yet they scar you for life. Death in this realm is a as real as you can get.*

Sam's anger prevented him from understanding - *"I told you to shut up!"*

*Here I thought you casted away what dragged you down. I thought you were acting in your lightness but, you continue to over-analyse everything, uh?* - replied the Bat.

Sam's mind engaged the words, it broke it down into its components. A cruel realisation started to bore into his anger. He remained quiet watching hatefully the Bat.

*I know quite too well that look, boy. You think I am a monster, that I am trying to play with your mind. Look there* - said the Bat pointing to the mayhem Sam left behind. The complexity of orbital dynamics were not necessary, the sea of debris crashing and clashing between each other fed a chain reaction destroying everything, the three islands were nothing more blobs surrounded by sticks and stones. Among the debris, Amir's and Hannah's bodies drifted aimlessly.

Tears surfaced on Sam's face - *"When are they going to wake up?"*

*Oh dear boy, you still don't get it, do you? They are gone for good* - replied the Bat, stretching its arms.

Sam wasn't sure why, it could have been the Bat always was this extremely menacing creature, or perhaps he felt so small and powerless - *"They can't be gone. This is not real!"*

The Bat calmly stretched its hands and wrapped it around Sam, lifting him up off the ground - *But you said it before, it felt 'off' from the beginning, didn't it?*

*"No, it can't be!"* - yelled Sam, a stream of tears covered his face - *"You are lying!"*

*Lying? You still don't understand the lightness of thoughts. In that case, let me wake you up, so you can face reality!* - said the Bat stepping closer to the edge of its island. Once at the edge, the Bat dropping Sam off its island, into the void.

Sam watched his former plane of existence move away from him, the darkness below slowly consumed his body until he disappeared.

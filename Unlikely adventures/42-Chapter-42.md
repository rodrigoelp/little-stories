# Magical deception

Back at the temple, Sam and Amir investigate the main hall, finding random items on the floor and wondering what happened before their arrival. Searching around the place, they find some stone tablets describing the history of the place, their main custodian (Father) and some description about him. Reading about it, the tablet describes some of the primordials, the children manage to link their experiences with the stories told on the tablets. Sam finds another tablet describing the City of Eden, and their significance as a place of knowledge and elevation for their civilisation.

Virgil appears from the shadows, Sam and Amir are surprised but not scared. Virgil welcomes them, asking about their little adventure, he confesses to himself, he missed the children despite the fact, they drive him crazy. The sound of a stick falling on the ground draws their attention, Amir runs to find out what could have been and finds the Shepherd's crook on the flood of the temple. He is in awe with his find.

Sam looks at it and thinks it has the appearance of the staff above the chair of Father. When Sam is about to touch it a spark of light sends him flying away. Virgil notices the glimmer on the staff. Virgil has the suspicion the staff has come looking for him, however, he doesn't want to interact with it just yet and tries to get Amir to leave it on the ground for him to comeback later, when the children are travelling. Virgil begins to usher Sam to return to the pond and urges the children to continue on their journey there are many realms between them and the mountain.

Amir, who has been playing with the staff, remembers Tiger's words in which a wizard needs to receive proper education later on, and the staff looks fairly magical. Virgil calls Amir once more and tells him to leave the staff on the ground. Amir, showing part of his rebellious wishes he doesn't need to leave the staff behind to which the staff shrinks in size and takes the shape of a small pendant, he places it around his neck and hides it under his robes.

He tend proceeds to run behind Virgil and Sam.

# Magical deception

It was a crown to be displayed, to infuse admiration and inspiration to anyone wandering around in the desert, that is the temple at Dawn, if you are wondering. It was a beacon summoning those searching for guidance and a jewel to those seeking beauty.

Sam ambled through the great hall, appreciating the intricate arabesques decorating the walls and floors; it seemed to him that every single inch of the temple, which the exception of the ceiling and the walls was covered in the floral arabesque pattern. Even the columns were covered in some sort of patterns, scales to be more precise, a gorgeous shiny scaled mosaic enhanced with playful shadows scared away by the light slipping through the gaps of the ancient lattice covers acting as a shade of sorts of the inhabitants of the temple... When there was someone inhabiting the temple, observed Sam.

*"Why would anybody make a book out of stones?"* - complained Amir's voice echoing from above Sam.

*"Pardon?"*

*"I've found some books, if you can call it that; it is six, some times seven, stonesheets connected with wires at the edges. I think it is utterly impractical to have to carry these around, so why make them out of stones?"* - the sound of stone leaning against stone was a dead giveaway that Amir was flicking through the so called "books".

*"Anything interesting?"* - Sam asked.

*"Mmh, not really. It would help if I was able to read any of it, thought."*

*"Then how can you tell if it is interesting or not?"* - Sam flapped a few times to reach the upper levels. Amir was nearby and Sam's curiosity took charge of his actions.

*"Anything without drawings is boring Sam."*

Amir had found a pile of books on the second floor, no more than a dozen or two, scribbled on with magic glowing gold with every flick of a page.

*"Rising a good smith and a difficult daughter"* - read Sam out loud - *"By the Sherpherd of Dawn."*

*"Uh?"* - there was a hint of surprise in Amir's voice - *"Can you read those?"*

Sam took another look at the pile, the book on top read ‘Memories of an old Shepard’ before to found Amir's inquisitive face - *"What was that?"*

Amir's gaze widened as he got a glance on Sam - *"Your eyes! Your eyes are glowing silver!"*

Indeed Sam's eyes had a silvery shimmer, enhancing his knowledge to reveal aspects of the world around it - *"Maybe the Wolf's magic allows me to read the books?"*

*"Is that what the blessings do?"*

Sam shrug, unfortunately the blessings came without the user's manual and he wasn't even aware how he began to use it. He crouched and picked up another book - *"Father of countless children."*

*"A family book?"* - asked Amir.

*"I... I don't think so"* - Sam began flicking through some of the pages - *"It talks about an adult called Father, he used to gather the children falling onto the realms and given them purpose."*

*"Ah, no pictures on this one either. I'm losing interest already"* - Amir picked up a broken cup and tossed it away. To his amusement the cup didn't shatter, instead, it hovered a few centimetres of the ground with a strange purposely-green glow.

*"Hannah explained the crook constellation when we did one of the trials, do you remember it? I think that crook, the Shepards staff was his."*

*"Cool"* - sarcastically added Amir.

Sam continued reading - *"I think that Father person was some sort of wizard."*

Amir appeared from within the shadows of one of the hallways - *"A wizard? Like the ones using a stick with sparks at its tip casting spells and stuff?"*

*"I'm not sure about sticks or sparks, it says here he had the power to influence the forces of life."*

*"I wonder if he can teach me how to use magic."* - Amir - *"Wait, ‘had’ and ‘was’? Isn't he around?"*

*"I don't think so, bud"* - said Sam showing the empty hall. Silence seemed to agree with Sam.

Sam picked up another book, this one was called ‘Before there was time’, he read a few pages - *"This one is about the spirits in the cave."*

*"Like the Tiger and the Spider?"* - Amir disappeared once more among one of the many dust covered shelves - *"Oh great! More books"*

Amir's snarky comment told Sam the books didn't have pictures on it - *"They were called primordials, the first elders to roam these lands. It says here they used to be six. The lonely wolf, the patient turtle, the changing bat, the wise spider, the silly tiger and... the last one is scratched. I think the Wolf told us about him... Was it Charon?"*

*"Charon, Charcoal... I don't know and I don't care"* - Amir resumed his rummaging activities beyond Sam's reach.

*"Don't you want to know about this stuff?"*

Amir's head poked several shelves away from where Sam's was standing - *"Mate, I got my fill of nerdy tidbits and trivia with Hannah. I need a crazy friend like I used to before the trials, not a friend getting excited with a book about people we met a few days ago."*

*"Spirits"* - corrected Sam.

*"Whatever! Let's do something fun! The girls are talking outside; let's fly around, try to discover what other things we can do with the blessings!"*

*"Like what?"*

*"Well, hopefully something more than just reading book!"* - Amir stroke a pose, almost as if he was about to do some fencing training with an imaginary sword - *"Hokus Pokus!"*

*"That never works."*

*"It might! Abracadabra!"*

*"Amir, you are making a lot of noise."*

*"So what? The place is empty! Alakazam!"*

*"Stop doing that, I wanted to read a little bit."*

*"No Sam! No! We were in that cave for like forever! I want to do something fun! Alohomora!"*

A shelf, coincidentally lost structural stability making a loud ‘crack!’ leaning forward towards Sam. The movement was enough to scare the children and perhaps, release a book or two, but nothing else. One of the books that fell a metre away from Sam was titled ‘Building a dream city. Eden's construction.’ - *"This one is about the place we are going to."*

*"What does it say?"*

Sam reads several pages, Amir momentarily forgot about the need to have fun - *"It says the city was built at the edge of what can be called the planet. It was built was a bridge between our world and the source of knowledge, it taught us how to manipulate the elements and how to expand technology. It seems the city was maintained by a lot of magic."*

*"Now that's interesting! Does it say how it was done? I mean, the magic."*

*"Yes Amir, it mentions how to get a philosophiae doctorate in magic with three easy to follow steps. It also has the schematics of the city and the dimensions of every single room for every single building in it"* - sarcastically.

*"Wow, really?"* - Amir studying a jar with several flying creatures.

*"Of course not! The book has like twenty pages and I have read eight."*

*"Building a dream city. Eden's construction. Very insightful book if I may add"* - Virgil.

Amir dashed out of the shadows covered shelves towards the narrow hallway in response to Virgil's statement, in what he hoped it was a casual appearance. However, the adjective better suited for the series of events would be: tumultuous or thunderous.

As Amir recognised Virgil's voice, he threw up in the air the jar he was holding in an attempt to make his way out into the hallway, forgetting in the process the large collections of mugs and cups he left on the floor as he deepened his exploration. The porcelain cups clanged and shattered as Amir rolled through them, leaning on one of the shelves causing a destructive chain reaction of Father's precious possession.

*"I cannot say I missed that particular attribute of our coexistence"* - commented Virgil as the jar shattered somewhere behind the mess of collapsed shelves - *"However, I did missed you little ones."*

Sam stood up quickly, followed by the big hug to the immaterial presence that was Virgil. As you would expect, Sam fell straight through Virgil hitting the banister with his nose - *"Ow!"*

Virgil crouched next to Sam, it was hard to imagine the sort of expression Virgil had at that precise moment when his face remained covered by his plain white mask, but Sam wanted to believe he had received a compassionate parental kind of look - *"I am glad you missed me too."*

*"Oue gut de blessins!"* - Sam

Virgil observed the little sparks changing colours on Sam's and Amir's chest, as he prepared to congratulate the pair a loud sound of an object breaking through the wood of the window covers, leaving behind the noise of the wood clashing against the ground further below.

*"Did you hear that?"* - Amir.

*"Hard not to"* - snarked Sam.

Virgil had not much time to react to the banalities of the physical world, he saw both kids jump off the edge towards the level below with inquisitive intent. Amir was the first one to land next to the remains of the once beautiful lattice slowing the wind coming into the building, however he could hear a low humming coming from the now covered throne in the middle of the hall - *"What's that?"*

*"What's what? If you are asking about the splinters I would hazard to say it is wood."*

*"Not that, the hum... Can't you hear it?"*

Amir was dead serious, Sam perceived, whatever it has the power to make Amir be this serious requires Sam's complete attention. He closed his eyes and listened to the sound of the dust settling on the surfaces.

"I can't hear a hum..."* - said Sam as his body registered a tinkle under his right foot. He bent forward to place a hand on the ground, the same tinkling sensation made his fingers buzz, almost as if he had trapped bees in a jar and buried underground - *"What is that? How can you hear that?"*

Amir walked around the splintered pile of wood until his senses found the source of the low frequency; without thinking too much, he dove in. One hand buried deep made way deeper and deeper, his fingers touched a smooth surface, sort of cylindrical, and he closed his grip on it.

**"I got it!"* - said Amir pulling out a long golden staff with the characteristic squared hook. The crook seemed to glow with every swing of his arm - *"Wow, it is gorgeous!"*

Amir had discovered something precious to him, at the very least attractive. It bothered Sam, there was something fishy on that staff falling out of the sky - *"I believe we should leave that where you found it."*

*"Why?"* - Amir tightens his grip on the crook, spinning it over his head. The staff seemed to follow every if his inner wishes - *"It might be handy."*

*"Amir, think about it. That staff fell out of nowhere, out of the blue, it went through the ceiling..."*

*"Window"* - corrected Amir.

Sam pinched the bridge of his nose in an attempt to resume his explanation - *"All I can see on that pile of rubble is nothing but... rubble, with the exception of that staff. What are the odds of an object falling through a ‘window’ and hummed drawing attention to itself?"*

Amir took another look at the staff, Sam had a point, it was quite rare to see a flying humming staff; not that he had the opportunity to observe any other or gather past events to confirm Sam's hypothesis, but even Virgil standing next to Sam had his bright blue eyes fixated on the stick on the palm of his hand - *"Maybe it is magical."*

*"I bet it is, I haven't seen many flying sticks ever"* - A bizarre image of women having broomsticks between their legs made him doubt for a second, but the mental image was gone when he tried to examined it.

Amir wanted to find the most logical explanation to the appearance of the mysterious article; it had an alluring warmth that travelled from your hand through your veins up to your flame, it made you feel you could overcome any challenge with it. Amir raised his gaze from it to Sam, but his eyes focused on the painting behind Sam.

The picture by itself wasn't that superb, it showed Father rearing children up to the point they could leave the temple on their own. But the part Amir found attractive was the drawing of the shepherd's crook used by Father - *"Maybe this is Father's staff, look at it!"*

Virgil's ephemeral persona rendered closer to Amir, placing his hands on his shoulders. Not that Amir was going to really feel it, but somehow, Amir turned - *"What do you think big guy?"*

*"I think about lack of trust and meddling in others affairs"* - replied the spirit, there wasn't any sentiment or tone added to it, it was a pure monotone comment. It bothered him the purplish-green glow trapped in the gem at the hook's base.

Amir could only follow it with - *"Pardon?"* - before Sam interrupted him.

*"Look bud, this temple is as old as... as very old things ought to be. Even older!"*

*"And?"*

*"Look around, there are several layers of dust on everything we touched. Now, are you telling me that stick stayed here all this time and didn't get rotten or anything like that? Even worst, are you going to tell me the stick crashed through what looks to me a pretty solid shade, it hummed for you to pick it up and now it is glowing with a golden light all by itself... and you don't see anything suspicious about it."*

*"If you put it like that everything would sound suspicious, no? I believe it was trying to find someone with some connection to magic!"* - Amir.

*"And that person is you?"*

*"Yeah? The Tiger said it when I was in the trial, he said I have a rare quality and it can make me a good wizard."*

Sam crooked the edge of his mouth thinking about the mysterious crook - *"Let me have a look at it."*

Amir reluctantly extended the staff for Sam to grab it, or that was the intent. As Sam reached out to touch the surface of the staff, it created an arc of pure energy sending Sam several metres away. The sound jittered Amir, who released the staff and ran to aid his friend.

*"Wha'appened??"* - Sam's hair stood up, separated by the strong repulsive effect of the magnetic induction in its fibres. It is also possible each hair decided to not like their neighbours that much, either way, the effect was the same. Little yellow jolts jumped between Sam's teeth as he spoke.

*"It... it wasn't me! I didn't do it Sam!"* - Amir doubted the sentence as each word left his mouth. Perhaps he was somewhat responsible, he remembered feeling awfully annoyed at Sam for doubting his magical potential. Amir waved his hand over Sam's hair whenever a new puff of smoked peeked out from the hairy mess - *"I am not quite sured what happened, but I wouldn't harm you Sam, I swear!"*

Sam looked apprehensively at the staff, it seemed to have a will on its own, he could feel it.

*"Amir, I would recommend you to leave it on the grown"* - Virgil emerged behind Father's chair. His gaze fixated on the staff - *"We don't know what force it might exert without the proper training and the results so far hasn't been precisely safe."*

*"It is not dangerous, it is just a stick!"* - protested Amir just in time for the staff to release another purple-greenish jolt that hit the wall a few feet behind Virgil leaving a mark on the plaster. Amir released his grip on the staff, letting it fall on the ground wondering if every time he felt annoyed the staff would react the same way.

*"I... I'm sorry..."* - he said as soon as he caught up Virgil's penetrating gaze.

It didn't last long; the stare that is. Virgil decided Sam required more attention than Amir's shocked expression of disbelief - *"Sam? Do you feel fine?"*

Sam smiled. A golden jolt arched between his teeth - *"Never been better miss!"*

Virgil felt the muscles around his neck tense, if he had any muscles and a material neck that could transmit sensory signals of pain - *"Come on Sam, I think the fresh air next to the pond might do you some good."*

Sam stretched his hand hoping Virgil would assist him in standing up. Virgil watched his immaterial hand and gave an apologetic look at Sam - *"I am afraid I can't help you that way."*

Sam gave Virgil a confused look, but to be honest, Sam had been giving off the same confused look to everything around him, leaned on a wall next to him and pushed himself up. He nodded as Virgil ushered him towards the outside.

*"Amir, we better get ready to depart. I believe your new companion has friends awaiting her. Her mood may have recovered by now"* - said Virgil somewhere closer to the entrance to the temple. Amir could tell it was the case, his voice wasn't as boomy as before - *"And leave that staff on the ground."*

Amir's hand froze a few centimetres above the staff, Virgil had that knack to know Amir's actions - *"Dang it"* - he whispered to himself - *"I know I can learn how to use this... I just need to practice."*

Amir didn't want to disobey Virgil, mainly because Virgil had this quality to make you feel very uncomfortable when he wasn't in a good mood, which from Amir's point of view, it was always. He took another look at the staff, it didn't really touch the ground, it hovered just above it, like the cup did a while back.

Amir couldn't sake Tiger's words, he could learn to use his magic with the help of wizards, but they haven't been around for ages. The staff clearly reacted to his thoughts, he just needed some time to get the hang of it, and he wasn't going to get any practice time with the staff floating on the ground of this temple.

*"I wished you weren't this bulky"* - said Amir to the object of his attention. Curiously, it pulsed with his magic colours when it began to twist itself.

The staff folded a few times, the hook at its top grew thicker and concave, the rest of it curved gently until it looked like a smoking pipe.

Amir was in awe, he wasn't sure what was going on, he just felt the staff wanted him to have it. He grabbed the pipe from the floor fumbling with it in his hands - *"What did you turn yourself into?"*

The pipe remembered how smoking isn't acceptable as a general rule, most Elders used to complain about Father's smoking habit. An image of a series of disappointed eyes watching over its mahogany exterior made it think on a different shape. The pipe glowed once more, creaking as it thinned and bulked at random places. The bright light of the transformation blinded Amir.

*"Amir? Stop sulking about the staff, leave it there and come here."* - the voice of Virgil from afar, it seemed to be getting closer.

Panic filled Amir's mind, he had disobeyed Virgil but he so wanted to have the staff, that reminded him, the source of warmth resting between his fingers. The staff had turned itself into a pendant with what appeared to be the sherpherd's constellation on its side. There wasn't much time to examine the pendant, Amir shoved it down his garments as Virgil peaked at the entrance of the temple - *"Are you coming?"*

Amir gave Virgil a wide smile - *"Yes sir, right away sir!"* - and marched straight out without any other complain.

It made Virgil suspicious, Amir had never been so respectful before.

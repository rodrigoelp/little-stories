# Magical deception

The temple above the Dawn's dunes was known as the treasure among the clouds; it infused admiration and inspiration to anyone wandering in the desert. The sunlight reflected on its exterior worked like a beacon summoning those searching for guidance, and to some extent water.

The temple was a jewel of splendid beauty shining through the the myst of the early morning.

Sam ambled through the great hall, appreciating the intricate arabesques decorating walls and floors; it seemed to him that every single inch of the temple, which the exception of the ceiling and the walls was covered in the complex floral pattern. Even the columns were covered in some sort of patterns, scales to be more precise, a gorgeous shiny scaled mosaic enhanced with playful shadows scared away by the light slipping through the gaps of ancient lattice covers acting as shade of sorts of the inhabitants of the temple; when there was someone inhabiting the temple, observed Sam.

Sam got dragged out of his peculiar admiration by a familiar voice.

*"Why would anybody make a book out of stones?"* - complained Amir. His voice echoed from above, on the second floor.

*"Pardon?"*

*"Just come up and take a look here. I've found some books, if you can call it that. It is a bunch of stone sheets wired up on one end. It is utterly impractical if you have to carry these around. This things are heavy! Why make them out of stone?"* - the sound of mineral leaning and rubbing against more mineral was a dead giveaway Amir flicked through the pages of the so called ‘books’.

*"Anything interesting?"* - Sam asked listening carefully, searching for Amir across all the echoes.

*"Mmh, not really. It would help if I was able to read any of it, thought."*

*"Then how can you tell if it is interesting or not?"* - Sam flapped a few times to reach the upper level. Amir was nearby, but Sam's curiosity took charge of his actions.

*"Anything without drawings is boring Sam."* - Amir had found a pile of books stacked on a shelf, no more than a dozen or two, scribbled on with magic that glowed golden illuminating Amir's face with every flick of a new page.

*"Training a good smith and rising a difficult daughter"* - read Sam out loud - *"By the Shepherd of Dawn."*

*"Uh?"* - there was a hint of surprise in Amir's voice - *"Can you read those?"*

Amir's voice was nothing more than a murmur in the background to Sam examining the covers of the books, the book near his right foot read ‘Memories of an old Shepard’ before he found Amir's inquisitive face - *"What was that?"*

Amir's gaze widened as he got a glance on Sam - *"Sam! Your eyes! Your eyes are glowing silver!"*

Indeed Sam's eyes had a silvery shimmer. It enhanced his knowledge revealing aspects of the world around him - *"Maybe I can read these books with the Wolf's magic..."*

*"Is that what the blessings do?"*

Sam shrug, unfortunately the blessings came without any user's manual and he wasn't even aware how the thing worked in the first place. He crouched to pick up another book - *"Father of countless children."*

*"A family book?"* - asked Amir.

*"I... I don't think so"* - Sam flicked through the content of the book - *"It talks about an adult called Father, he used to gather the children falling onto the realms and given them purpose."*

*"Ah, no pictures on this one either. I'm losing interest already"* - Amir picked up a broken cup to toss it to shelves further away.

The cup bounced of the edge of the board and arched towards the ground. To Amir's amusement the cup didn't shatter when it reached the ground, instead, it hovered two centimetres from the surface, growing with a strange purply-green aura.

*"Hannah talked about the crook constellation when we did one of the trials, do you recall any of it? I think that crook, the Shepards staff was his. This father person must be the Shepard."*

*"Cool"* - added Amir with more than a pinch of sarcasm.

Sam resumed his reading, following the glowing letter with his index finger - *"Father must have been some sort of wizard."*

Amir appeared from within the shadows of one of the hallways - *"A wizard? Like the ones using a stick shooting sparks from its tip casting spells and stuff?"*

*"I'm not sure about sticks or sparks, it says here he had the power to influence the forces of life."*

*"Like a necromancer?"*

*"Not like a necroman..."* - Sam's curiosity pulled him out of the book - *"Show me your hands!"*

*"Why? What's up with you guys and my hands?"*

Sam knew Amir wasn't carrying any book with him, but he began to be suspicious of Amir's recent lexicon extension - *"Forget it."*

*"I wonder if he can teach me how to use magic."* - Amir thoughts rushed through the idea of becoming a wizard. However, his brain picked up the subtle emphasis on the things that are no more - *"Wait, ‘had’ and ‘was’? Isn't he around?"*

*"I don't think so, bud"* - Sam waved an arm showing the empty hall. Silence seemed to agree with him. He picked up another book, this one was called ‘Time and space, and its bastard child: spacetime’, he read a few pages - *"This one is about the spirits in the cave."*

*"Like the Tiger and the Spider?"* - Amir disappeared once more into the hallways surrounded by dust covered shelves - *"... Oh great! More books"*

Amir's snarky comment told Sam that said books didn't have any pictures in it - *"They were called the primordials, the first elders to roam these lands. It says here they used to be six. The lonely wolf, the patient turtle, the changing bat, the wise spider, the silly tiger and... the last one is scratched. I think the Wolf told us about him... Was it Charon?"*

*"Charon, Charcoal, Charizar, Chorizo... I don't know and I don't care"* - Amir resumed his rummaging activities beyond Sam's reach.

*"Don't you want to know about this stuff?"*

Amir's head poked several shelves away from where Sam's sat reading - *"Mate, I've got my fill of nerdy tidbits and trivia with Hannah. I need a crazy friend like I used to have before the trials, not a friend getting excited about books of people we met a few days ago."*

*"Spirits"* - corrected Sam.

*"Whatever! Let's do something fun, Sam! The girls are talking outside; let's fly around, do anything fun... let's find out what else we can do with the blessings!"*

*"Like what?"*

*"Well, hopefully something more than just reading book!"* - Amir stroke a pose as if he practiced for fencing with an imaginary sword - *"Hokus Pokus!"*

*"That would never work."*

*"It might! Abracadabra!"*

*"Amir, you are making a lot of noise."*

*"So what? The place is empty! Alakazam!"*

*"Stop doing that, I want to read some more."*

*"No Sam! No! We were in that cave for like forever! I want fun and I want it now! Alohomora!"*

A shelf nearby coincidentally lost structural stability, or stumbled on Amir's terms, making a loud ‘crack!’ leaning forward, towards Sam. The movement was enough to scare the children and perhaps, release a book or two, but nothing else. One of the books that fell a metre away from Sam was titled ‘Building a dream city. Eden's construction.’ - *"This one is about the place we are going to."*

*"What does it say?"*

Sam reads several pages, Amir momentarily forgot about his painful boredom - *"It says the city was built at the edge of what can be called the planet. It was a bridge between our world and the source of knowledge, it taught us how to manipulate the elements and how to expand technology. It says the only viable way to maintain the city was by using lots of magic."*

*"Now that's interesting! Does it say how it was done? I mean, the magic part."*

*"Yes Amir, it mentions how to get a philosophiae doctorate in magic with three easy to follow steps. It also has the schematics of the city and the dimensions of every single room for every single building in it"* - Sam replied sarcastically.

*"Wow, really?"* - said Amir studying a jar with several flying creatures painted on it.

*"Of course not! The book isn't that thick. I have read eight pages, what do you think?"*

*"Building a dream city. Eden's construction. Very insightful book if I may add"* - In his traditional fashion, Virgil had appeared silently behind Sam, spooking him in the process.

Amir dashed out of the shadows encased with the shelves towards the narrow hallway in response to Virgil's statement, in what he hoped it was a casual appearance. However, the adjective better suited for the series of events would be: tumultuous or thunderous.

As Amir recognised Virgil's voice, he threw up in the air the jar he was holding in an attempt to make his way out into the hallway, forgetting the large collections of mugs and cups he had left on the floor as he deepened his exploration. The porcelain cups clanged and shattered due to the weight of a stumbling Amir, rolling on the ground with the momentum. The shower of debris wasn't the only effect of the spectacularly clumsy fall; Amir bumped his body against one of the shelves, causing a destructive chain reaction of Father's precious possession.

*"I cannot say I missed that particular attribute of our coexistence"* - commented Virgil watching one final jar shattering somewhere behind the mess of collapsed shelves - *"Surprisingly, I did missed you little ones."*

Sam stood up quickly wanting to give a big hug to the immaterial presence that was Virgil. It was to expect, Sam fell straight through Virgil's chest hitting his nose with the banister - *"Ow!"*

Virgil crouched next to Sam, it was hard to imagine the sort of expression Virgil had right at that moment given his face remained covered by his plain white mask, but Sam wanted to believe he had received a compassionate parental kind of look - *"I am glad you missed me too."*

*"Oue gut de blessins!"* - Sam rubbed his nose side to side, hoping the friction could alleviate the pain. It did not.

Virgil's gaze drifted towards the little sparks changing colours on Sam's and Amir's chests. It had been a long time since the last time he had congratulated anybody, but Virgil knew the power of positive reinforcement, it usually make others act foolishly, acting entitled with their chest filled with pride due to the parental recognition.

Virgil meditated what would be the best course to take, ignore the pair or address their achievement. He didn't have the chance to take a decision, a loud smashing sound of wood breaking and shattering guided them to the window covers raining down the main hall, the debris clashed against the ground further below.

*"Did you hear that?"* - Amir leaned on the banister, lifting his body to gain better perspective.

*"Hard not to"* - snarked Sam still rubbing his nose.

Virgil wasn't used to reacting to the banalities of the physical world. There was not much point in getting emotional with loud noises around you. Hard to lose your life when you aren't alive.

Virgil saw both kids jump off the edge towards the level below, following their inquisitive instincts.

Amir landed first next to the remains of the once beautiful lattice slowing the sunlight and diverting out the wind coming into the building.

The scene grew quieter with each passing second. Slowly, even the most aggressive speck of dust settled on the ground, going to sleep. Amir listened carefully, there was a low humming sound coming from the new covered throne in the middle of the hall - *"What's that?"*

*"What's what? If you are asking about the splinters I would hazard to say it is splintered wood."* - said Sam lifting the remains that landed on Father's throne.

*"Not that, the hum. Can't you hear it?"* - Amir was dead serious, Sam perceived. Whatever it had the power to surface Amir's seriousness required Sam's complete attention. He closed his eyes and listened to the sound filling up the room.

"I hear nothing"* - Sam hadn't finished phrasing his conclusions when his body registered a tinkle under his right foot. He bent forward to place a hand on the ground, the same tinkling sensation made his fingers buzz, almost as if he had trapped bees in a jar and buried underground, but there was no sound - *"What is that? How can you hear that?"*

Amir walked around the rubble until his senses spotted the source of the low frequency; without overthinking it, he dove in. One hand buried deep made its way deeper and deeper, his fingers touched a smooth polished surface, sort of cylindrical, and he closed his fingers around it.

**"I've got it!"* - Amir pulled with all his might, freeing up a long golden staff with a very recognisable squared hook on one end. The crook glowed with every swing of his arm - *"Wow, it is gorgeous!"*

Amir's heart had found a second source of palpitations, the staff was very attractive.

Sam looked up, he was suspicious of the string of events - *How can an object so thin and brittle can make a whole that big? The window cover feels very sturdy and that tingling...* - The more he thought about it, the least he liked the idea of a stick falling out of the sky, it was almost eldersent - *"We should leave that where we found it."*

*"Why?"* - Amir tightened his grip on the crook, it made his flame glow whiter. Amir opened his hand, the staff remained on it, almost as if the staff followed every single one of his inner wishes - *"It might be handy."*

*"Amir, think about it. That thing came out of nowhere, out of the blue, it went through the ceiling..."*

*"Window"* - corrected Amir.

Sam pinched the bridge of his nose in an attempt to regain some patience, it wasn't successful and reminded him about his sore nose - *"All I can see on that pile of rubble is nothing but... rubble, with the exception of that unharmed glowing stick. What are the odds of an object falling through a narrow **window** and hummed to draw attention to itself?"*

Amir took another look at the staff, Sam had a point, it was quite rare to see an unbreakable flying humming staff; not that he had the opportunity to observe any other in the past to confirm Sam's hypothesis. Virgil had his bright blue eyes fixated on the staff on the palm of his hand - *"Maybe it is magical"* - he ventured.

*"I bet it is, I haven't seen many flying sticks... ever!"* - A bizarre image of women having broomsticks between their legs made Sam doubt for a second, but the mental image was gone before he tried to examined it.

Amir wanted to find the most logical explanation to the appearance of the mysterious article; it had an alluring warmth that travelled from the tip of his fingers through his veins up to his flame. It made him feel like he could overcome any challenge ahead of his path.

Amir raised his gaze from it to Sam, but his eyes focused on the painting behind Sam.

The picture by itself wasn't that superb, it showed Father rearing children up to the point they could leave the deserted shores of Dawn. But the part Amir found the most attractive was the drawing of the shepherd's crook used by Father - *"Maybe this is Father's staff, look at it!"*

Virgil's ephemeral presence appeared behind Amir, placing his hands on his shoulders. Not that Amir would be able to really feel it, but somehow, he turned - *"What do you think about this, big guy?"*

*"I think this shows lack of trust from someone meddling in others affairs"* - replied the spirit, there wasn't any sentiment or tone added to it, it was a pure monotone comment. Deep down, it bothered him the purplish-green glow trapped in the gem at the hook's base.

*"Pardon?"* - said Amir.

Sam was slowing losing the will to deal with Amir's recent attachment - *"Look, let's agree the situation is suspicious, leave the stick there and let's get out of here."*

*"How is a simple stick suspicious?"*

*"We have been through this Amir. I don't like it, let's leave it there. You don't know if the stick has an owner responding to."*

*"Maybe it is seeking for someone with a strong magical connection..."* - said Amir apprehensively. The staff now felt like an extension of his own arm.

*"And that person is you?"*

*"Yeah? The Tiger said it when I was in the trial, he said I have a rare quality and it can make me a good wizard."*

Sam crooked the edge of his mouth thinking about the mysterious crook - *"Let me have a look at it."*

*"No! Why?"* - Amir blocked Sam's hand reaching to the staff.

*"I want to know if it is safe."*

Amir felt Sam's stare, he was appalled by the treatment he was receiving. He knew Sam was his best friend, but the thought of giving the staff to someone else made his guts turn. He gave another look at the staff.

*What a silly feeling... Sam is not going to do anything bad to it* - he thought, arguing with himself. He slowly extended the staff towards Sam to grab it, or that was the intent.

As soon as Sam reached out to touch the surface of the staff, an arc of pure energy sent Sam flying several metres away.

The loud crackling sound jittered Amir, who released the staff, dropping it on the floor and ran to aid his friend.

*"Wha'appened??"* - Sam's hair stood up, separated by the strong repulsive reaction of the magnetic induction of similar polarity in its fibres. It is also possible each hair strand decided to not like their neighbours very much; either way, the effect was the same. Little bright golden jolts jumped between Sam's teeth.

*"It... it wasn't me! I didn't do it Sam!"* - Amir doubted the sentence as each word left his mouth. Perhaps he was somewhat responsible, he remembered feeling awfully annoyed at Sam for doubting his magical potential. Amir waved his hand over Sam's hair whenever a new puff of smoked peeked out from the hairy mess - *"I am not quite sure what happened, but I wouldn't harm you Sam, I swear!"*

Sam in his confused state, looked apprehensively at the staff. It seemed to have a will on its own, he could feel it, but he didn't want to confront Amir about it any more.

*"Amir, I would recommend you to leave the staff on the ground"* - Virgil emerged behind Father's chair.

Virgil appeared and felt more real than ever before. His gaze fixated on the staff - *"We don't know what force it might exert without the proper training and the results so far hasn't been precisely safe to those around you."*

*"It is not dangerous, it is just a stick!"* - Amir felt annoyed at the lack of trust from Sam and Virgil. He waved the staff from side to side to demonstrate his control over the object, but the staff released another purple-greenish jolt; hitting the wall a few feet behind Virgil leaving a deep mark on the plaster. Amir wondered if his feelings drove the staff to react so uncontrollably. His gaze crossed with Sam's fearful expression, it made him release his grip on the staff.

*"I... I'm sorry..."* - he said as soon as he caught up Virgil's penetrating gaze.

It didn't last long; the stare that is. Virgil decided Sam required more attention than Amir's shocked expression of disbelief - *"Sam? How do you feel? Are you Ok?"*

Sam smiled. A golden jolt arched between the teeth of his upper and lower jaw - *"it is a beautiful day, miss!"*

Virgil felt the muscles around his neck tense, if he had any muscles and a material neck that could transmit sensory signals of pain - *"Come on Sam, I think the fresh air next to the pond might do you some good."*

Sam stretched his hand hoping Virgil would assist him to stand up. Virgil watched his immaterial hand and gave an apologetic look at Sam - *"I am afraid you would have to do this part by yourself."*

Sam gave Virgil a confused look, but to be honest, Sam had been giving off the same disoriented look to anything around him since he was blasted by the staff. He leaned on a wall next to him and pushed himself up. He nodded as Virgil ushered him towards the outside.

*"Amir, we shall get ready to depart. I believe your new companion has friends awaiting for her. She must have recovered by now"* - said Virgil somewhere closer to the entrance to the temple. Amir could tell it was the case, his voice wasn't as boomy as before - *"And **leave that darn staff on the ground**."*

Amir's hand froze mid way to grab the staff, Virgil had that knack to know Amir's actions - *"Dang it"* - he whispered to himself - *"I know I can learn how to use you... I just need to practice."*

Amir didn't want to disobey Virgil, mainly because Virgil had this skill to make you feel very uncomfortable when he wasn't in a good mood, which from Amir's point of view, it was always.

It was such a shame to leave such a valuable item on the ground, and now that he took another glance at it, the staff never touched the ground, it hovered above it, just like the cup did a while back.

Amir couldn't sake Tiger's words, he could learn to use his magic with the help of wizards, but they haven't been around for ages. The staff clearly reacted to his thoughts, he just needed some time to get the hang of it, and he wasn't going to get any practice time with the staff floating above the ground of the temple.

*"I wished you weren't this bulky"* - said Amir to the object of his attention. Curiously, it pulsed with his magical colours when it began to twist onto itself.

The staff folded a few times, the hook at its top grew thicker and concave, the rest of it curved gently until it looked like a smoking pipe.

Amir was in awe, he wasn't sure what was going on, but watching the staff change shapes was certainly entertaining. He picked up the pipe, fumbling with it - *"What did you turn yourself into?"*

The pipe appeared to consider the age bracket of its current bearer and how smoking isn't acceptable as a general rule. It seems to have pondered about the multiple complains the Elders directed at Father's smoking habit. An image of a series of disappointed eyes watching over its clear maple exterior made it think on a different shape, one more suited for children.

The pipe glowed once more, creaking as it thinned and bulked at random places. The bright light of its transformation blinded Amir.

*"Amir? Stop sulking about the staff, leave it behind and come here."* - Virgil's voice seemed to be getting closer; odd for an spirit to walk around as opposed to just materialise behind him.

Panic filled Amir's mind, he didn't want to leave such a quirky artefact behind. That reminded him, the source of warmth resting between his fingers. The staff had turned itself into a pendant with what appeared to be the Shepherd's constellation on its side. Amir shoved it down his garments just before Virgil's head peaked at the entrance of the temple - *"Are you coming?"*

Amir gave Virgil a wide smile - *"Yes sir, right away sir!"* - and marched straight out without any other objection.

It made Virgil suspicious, Amir had never been so respectful before - *"Show me your hands!"*

*"I do not have the dictionarium!"* - replied Amir, somewhat irritated, yet he opened his empty hands towards Virgil.

# Blowing on cinders

Amir's head felt about to explode under the details Hannah tried to explain to him - *"So... was she the daughter of the spirit?"*

*"No Amir, **she** was Air's spirit"* - clarified Hannah.

*"But she looks nothing like the spirit!"* - he replied.

*"She had the mask of the Bat!"* - Hannah argued.

*"I mean, sure. She had that, but what else?"* - he stubbornly replied.

*"Her clothes? Her wings? How about Sam recognising her immediately as Air's spirit and her flame was lime coloured."* - replied Hannah mansplaining the situation... Erm, girlsplaining the situation... just explaining it to Amir.

Amir came to a stop, paralysed by the sight of four spirits already assembled around the pillar in the cave. Three glowing symbols revealed their success - *"Good, no spooky apparitions this time, huh?"*

A gush of air puffed by Amir's and Hannah's legs.

*"What was that?"* - asked Amir.

Hannah opened her mouth to answer, but she was cut short by the materialisation, or rather the spiritualisation of the Bat. Hannah just pointed as if it was enough explanation.

*"That's a nice trick, uh?"* - said Sam behind them, catching up with them.

*"Did she move like that in the trial?"* - asked Hannah, grasping the subtle movements of the Bat interacting with the other spirits.

*"Not quite"* - he replied - *"But it isn't important any more. Are you guys ready to start the next one?"*

*"Yes"* - replied Hannah.

*"No"* - replied Amir - *"But it doesn't matter, does it? I just want this over with."*

*"Why not?"* - said Sam puzzled at Amir's reluctance.

Sam's and Hannah's chests produced little coloured sparks, in addition to their own white flames. It revealed they had attained the blessings of the previous spirits. Sam's shot pale blue and lime ones, Hannah's shot little yellow, almost golden rays. Amir looked down to his own, pale colourless flame, then back to Sam and shrugged. Amir felt somewhat useless - *"I dunno. It is not important Sam. Let's get moving. The faster you end this, the better."*

*"Don't worry Amir, everything is going to be fine. You'll see!"* - added Hannah. She grasped some of the hopelessness in Amir's voice, though she couldn't understand the reason.

***Children? It is time!*** - called the Wolf.

*So you guys got the blessing of our fluffy puffy softy bubble of air!* - added the Spider, greeting the children.

*"Moss! Call me Moss!"* - scolded the Bat.

*Ok little Mossy... Do not get upset, mmkay?* - added the Turtle with a hint of motherly tone.

The bat rolled her eyes - *"I **am** older than most of you."*

**Let's focus on the children.** - added the Wold.

*But we wuv you our fluffy puffy little batsie Moss* - said the Spider to the Bat's discontent.

*"Just because I look like a little girl does not give you the right to make fun of me!"* - scolded the Bat again.

The Wolf had to maintain his spectral composure in front of the children. He had worked so hard to be respected but the elemental guardians kerfuffled over trivial matters - ***You all should behave in accordance to your old age.***

*"Uh oh"* - said Amir as he recognised the classical phrasing of words that would lead you to appreciate the taste of your own foot.

The three elemental spirits instantly stopped their chatter and gasped to the statement. 

*"You didn't just say that!"* - said the Bat recovering from her shock.

*Old? OLD? I'll show you who's old!* - added the Turtle rolling up the sleeves of her robe.

*You son of a she-wolf! We are on the prime of our youth!* - screeched the Spider demanding an apology.

***Prime of your youth? We already were teenagers when time began to flow!*** - argued the Wolf, feeling he had been dragged to the futile bickering.

*"Shooshh!"* - commanded the Bat for certain secrets to remain forgotten - *"Let's agree in that we preserve quite well."*

***... If we were more preserved the children would read our names as Tutancanis, PteroBattyl, Turtlesaurus and Megarachne...*** - murmured the Wolf - ***Anyhow. Children! Let us examine your blessings!***

Hannah gave a furtive look at Sam and mimicked his movements. Sam rendered his hands close to his chest whilst in his chest two coloured sparks danced a waltz without touching each other. A bluish flame arched and poured towards his right hand, followed by a fizzy lime-coloured spark that whirled between the fingers of his other hand.

Hannah observed her own flame divide in two: a powdery yellow flame moved away of a pure white one that remained on her chest. The flame appeared to be more solid than the ones moving on Sam's hand, yet didn't feel heavy at all.

***You've done well.*** - said solemnly the Wolf - ***But why is it the blessing has been given to just two?***

Amir's flame sunk into his chest and it skipped a beat. He remembered Hannah's words when they roamed the labyrinth - *Maybe I am not good enough to be in the group...* - He thought.

Sam placed his arm around Amir's shoulders and smiled with confidence - *"I can share one of these with my pal, no?"

*The blessings choose the carrier. They aren't things to be exchanged.* - clarified the Spider.

*And never say things like these in the next trial* - added the Turtle

*"Eek! Imagine if the Tiger heard!"* - followed the Bat.

***Quiet!*** - the Wolf was fixated on a big silhouette moving towards their location.

Sam pictured a fierce quadruped predator, enraged with his insolence, ready to exchange a word or two before throwing them to a hellish trial.

Hannah could distinguish the rough shape approaching. It was twice as tall as the Wolf and about three times as wide. She heard the thumps of each steps as the Tiger walked.

Amir curiously watched the spectre closing the distance.

The tiger stopped a few metres away from the children and raised his arms up in the air. An explosion of light filled the cavern as every candle burst in flames. Columns of fire rose behind the Tiger making him appear even bigger still.

The light revealed the giant in front of the children; a giant wearing a tiger mask decorated with red and orange markings, a thick dark-orange hunter coat that covered most of his body with the exception of his large belly. A big smile on his face.

He lowered his hands to observe the children. The columns of fire behind him had quiet down leaving scorching marks on the walls and the roof. There, the tiger inspected the three impressionable children.

**GREETINGS AND FELICITATIONS!** - he yelled.

*Spidie... Why is he talking like that?* - whispered the Turtle.

*Beats me.* - replied the Spider.

**I AM DA ASTROPHYSICAL ENTITY OF DA FOURTH STATE OF MATTER AND I'VE COME WITH PROVOCATIONS FOR DOSE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE DE ENDEAVOUR!** - yelled the Tiger.

The Wolf lowered his head into his hand and covered his eyes with it - ***Oh dear...***

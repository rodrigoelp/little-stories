# Blowing on cinders

Amir's head throbbed intensely, almost to the verge of exploding, dealing with the amount of details explained by Hannah - *"Hang on, so the little girl was the daughter of the spirit?"*

Hannah felt her explanations were as useful as raking the sea - *"No Amir, **she** was Air's spirit."*

*"How can that be? She looks nothing like the statue of the spirit!"* - argued Amir. He remembered the aggressive expression of the sculpture on the walls of the cave and compared it to the gentle, almost delicate girl talking to Sam.

*"She had the Bat's mask!"* - Hannah argued back.

*"I mean, sure. She had that, but what else?"* - he stubbornly replied.

*"Her clothes? Her wings? How about Sam recognising her immediately as Air's spirit and her flame was lime coloured."* - replied Hannah mansplaining the situation... Erm, girlsplaining the situation... just explaining it to Amir.

*"Pff, just that?"* - It is a well known fact in those world were apples tend to fall on bright smart people, that every action is meant with an equal reaction to counteract its force; that is due to the fact, these people have not met Amir in which case, they would have added a caveat to the law excluding Amir's stubbornness, every unit of reason was met with a disproportionate opposite reaction.

Amir came to a stop. The sight of three spirits assembled around the pillar in the cave gave him chills on his back. Three glowing symbols revealed their previous successes - *"Good, no spooky apparitions this time, huh?"*

A gush of air puffed by Amir's and Hannah's legs.

*"What was that?"* - asked Amir.

Hannah opened her mouth to answer, but she was cut short by the materialisation, or rather the spiritualisation of the Bat. Hannah just pointed as if it was enough explanation.

*"That's a nice trick, uh?"* - said Sam behind them, catching up with them.

*"Did she move like that in the trial?"* - asked Hannah, grasping the subtle movements of the Bat interacting with the other spirits. The Bat was the epiphany of immaterial energy circling around every living being, or non-living as it was the case at this moment.

*"Not quite"* - he replied. Sam wanted to explain the multiple facets of the Bat; it was complicated and he didn't want to drill down the details - *"Shall we get started with the next one?"*

*"Yes"* - replied Hannah filled with the expectation of the unknown.

*"No"* - replied Amir with disdain - *"But it doesn't matter, does it? I just want this over with."*

*"Why not?"* - said Sam puzzled at Amir's reluctance.

Amir's gaze drifted from their faces to their chests and the lights hosted on them. Their chests shimmered with sparkles of coloured light around the white beating flame, revealing they had attained the blessings of the previous spirits. Sam's shot in pulses pale blue sparks curling in the air; the rest were lime coloured ones, bubbling away. Hannah's flame shot little yellow, almost golden rays, like a little sun burping a powerful flare.

Amir looked down to his own pale colourless flame, then back to Sam and shrugged. Amir felt somewhat useless - *"I dunno. It is not important Sam. Let's get moving. The faster you end this, the better."*

*"Don't worry Amir, everything is going to be fine. You'll see!"* - added Hannah. She grasped some of the hopelessness in Amir's voice, though she couldn't understand the unspoken reason.

***Children?*** - called the Wolf - ***It is time!***

*This is so exciting!* - added the Spider, greeting the children - *You got the blessing of our fluffy puffy softy bubble of air!*

*"Moss! Call me Moss!"* - scolded the Bat.

*Ok! liwwle Mossy... Do not get upset, mmkay?* - added the Turtle with a hint of motherly tone. It was obviously the type of motherly tone people should abstain of ever doing in public.

*"I **am** older than most of you."* - said the Bat rolling her eyes - *"I walked this planet way before any of you crashed on the desert!"*

**Let's focus on the children.** - interrupted the Wolf in an attempt to keep the story flowing.

*But we wuv you our fluffy puffy little batsie Moss* - said the Spider to the Bat's discontent.

*"Just because I look like this does not give you the right to make fun of me!"* - scolded the little girl wearing the Bat's mask.

The Wolf had to maintain his spectral composure in front of the children. He had worked so hard to be respected, to be a fearful guide to those seeking illumination. But the elemental guardians kerfuffled over trivial matters - ***You all should behave in accordance to your old age.***

*"Uh oh"* - said Amir as he recognised the classical composition of words forming a phrasing that would lead you to appreciate the taste of your own foot.

The three elemental spirits instantly stopped their chatter and gasped to the statement. Even in the afterlife there are subjects, such as revealing the age of anybody with a pair of the same sex chromosome unless you are a platypus, that should never be used as an argument.

*"You didn't just say that!"* - said the Bat recovering from her shock.

*Old? OLD? I'll show you who's old!* - added the Turtle rolling up the sleeves of her robe.

*You son of a she-wolf! We are on the prime of our youth!* - screeched the Spider demanding an apology.

***Prime of your youth? We already were teenagers when time began to flow!*** - argued the Wolf, feeling he had been dragged to the futile bickering.

*"Shooshh!"* - commanded the Bat for certain secrets to remain forgotten - *"Let's agree in that we preserve quite well."*

***... If we were more preserved the children would read our names as TutanCanis, PteroBattyl, Turtlesaurus and Megarachne...*** - murmured the Wolf. He felt murdering intent drifting in the air, his self preservation kicked in and his lips moved - ***Anyhow: Children! Let us examine your blessings!***

Hannah gave a furtive look at Sam, who had rendered his hands closer to his chest. Between his fingers she saw the two coloured sparks danced a waltz without touching each other. A bluish flame arched and poured towards his right hand, followed by a fizzy lime-coloured spark that whirled between the fingers of his other hand.

She decided to mimic him and covered his flame with her hands, she observed her own flame divide in two: the powdery yellow spark sifted out through the pure white fire. The flame appeared to be more solid than the ones moving on Sam's hand, yet didn't feel heavy.

***You've done well.*** - said solemnly the Wolf, inspecting the children in front of him - ***But why is it the blessing has been given to just the two of you?***

Amir's flame sunk into his chest, filled with ache whilst it skipped a beat. He remembered Hannah's words as they roamed the labyrinth - *Maybe I am not good enough to be in the group...* - He thought.

Sam placed his arm around Amir's shoulders and smiled with confidence - *"I can share one of these with my pal, no?"*

*Each blessing chooses its carrier* - clarified the Spider - *They aren't things to be exchanged, they are living entities looking for those worthy of hosting them.*

*And never say things like these in the next trial...* - cautioned the Turtle, almost as if she traded a dangerous secret.

*"Eek!"* - said the Bat remembering one of their companions - *"Imagine if the Tiger heard!"*

***Quiet!*** - the Wolf was fixated on a big silhouette moving towards their location.

*A tiger?* - thought Sam as he pictured a ferocious quadruped predator, enraged with his insolence, ready to exchange a word or two before throwing them to a hellish trial.

Hannah could distinguish the rough shape approaching. It was twice as tall as the Wolf and about three times as wide. She heard the thumps of each steps as the Tiger walked.

Amir curiously watched the spectre closing the distance between them and itself, each step covered a few metres at a time.

The Tiger stopped a few metres away from the children and raised his arms up in the air, an explosion of light filled the cavern as every candle burst in flames. Columns of fire rose behind the Tiger making him appear even more imposing. His amber slit eyes pierced through the shadows.

The children were in awe with the shape of an enormous creature in front of them; a giant wearing a tiger mask decorated with red and orange markings, a thick dark-orange hunter coat that covered most of his body with the exception of his large belly. The big smile on his face showed his fangs.

He recovered his calmed pose and stared at the children. The columns of fire behind him had quiet down leaving scorching marks on the walls and the roof. There, the Tiger showed his bright amber eyes analysing three impressionable children.

After a few moments, he filled his lungs and yelled - **GREETINGS AND FELICITATIONS!**

His voice echoed through the silent cavern.

*Spidie... Why is he talking like that?* - whispered the Turtle.

*Beats me.* - replied the Spider.

**I AM DA ASTROPHYSICAL ENTITY OF DA FOURTH STATE OF MATTER AND I'VE COME WITH PROVOCATIONS FOR DOSE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE DE ENDEAVOUR!** - yelled the Tiger.

The Wolf lowered his head into his hand and covered his eyes with it - ***Oh dear...***

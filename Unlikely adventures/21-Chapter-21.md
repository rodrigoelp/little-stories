# One's reflection

Sam remained behind as he stared to the giant black gate, bend and filled with deep gushes of, what it seemed to be, the largest blade ever used - *"Are you sure there's no puzzle, riddle or challenge we need to solve?"* - he asked to Hannah, hypnotised by the damaged object.

*"Look at it Sam, it is destroyed. Even the gems are gone. Whatever it could have been there to challenge us, is missing."* - replied Hannah. She struggled to keep walking in a straight line with Amir weighting her down.

Sam checked the sculpted shield in the middle of the twisted gate, seven holes marked the location where gems should have been emitting the soft pale blue glow.

Sam felt chills running down his spine just thinking about the creature or event that caused this mayhem, it was disturbing and unpleasant to imagine it. His eyes travelled from the black contorted mess to the last known place his brain remembered the location of his friends. Sam stopped at the beginning of the alley, completely alone.

*"Hannah?"* - he asked with a hint of terror and a sprinkle of horror.

*"Just walk ahead Sam, ignore it and walk past it."* - suggested Hannah's voice to Sam.

Sam stood immobile a few seconds processing Hannah's words. He mustered the courage to walk down the alley between the black gate behind him and the unknown beyond.

The alley, as Sam could describe it, seemed to be disconnected from the rest of the maze.

Somehow, the mysterious source of illumination for the entire maze had trouble reaching to the inner parts of the alley; just a few rays of light barely managed to bounce off a few areas on the wall, the other areas were either covered in stains or it revealed the damage done to its surface; it casted eerie shadows on the ground, Sam couldn't understand at first what he saw on it.

His eyes wrestled to adjust to the dimmed area and make up features or the contour of the things out of the actual shadows. The alley's floor was covered in stains and splatter patterns.

His eyes tuned, as eyes normally would when you spend enough time in the darkness, to see different shades of black. He could see the difference between shadows, the splattered pattern and a large collection of decayed bones and skulls that littered the ground. It was gruesome; it made him feel sick.

His brain gave him after images of the scene, even after he had closed his eyes. Hannah had marked, unwillingly, the path she took dragging Amir whilst she pushed to the side the piles of remains ahead of her.

His brain told his feet to move, the knees intercepted the message and replied “*Are you crazy?*”

His brain insisted, the knees replied “*But, are you seeing this? No! I won't move. No!*”

His brain made the compelling case that, whatever it happened to them may have been caused by staying in the alley for too long. The message finally went through.

He began his walk slowly, but, as things would go when a child walks into a scary place, at the tiniest creak or crunching sound, he darted towards the end of the alley as his imagination betrayed him: it projected images of bones dancing to a hidden tune, composing an army of undead about to chase him.

Sam jumped out of the alley and landed in a circular room leaving behind the entrance to the room and a gate in front of him. Sam tried to walk further away from the scary alley and bumped against Amir, who remained on the floor with his face totally bruised and swollen.

Amir looked serene, though Sam would have imagined that he remained calm as he could not see the creepy place they were standing on. Amir barely moved to reveal Hannah, who had collapsed completely exhausted after carrying Amir out of the alley.

Sam looked back expecting the ghastly images to become reality, but nothing came out from the alley thought, Sam noticed, the entrance to the room had dark stains spreading outwards, like tentacles would sprout out of a bottle if you assume you placed a very pissed off octopus inside of it. The dark tentacles came to an abrupt end near the middle of the room, there was some sort of magical force that protected it from the incoming creature.

*"Where are we?"* - he asked still fixated on the dark pattern.

*"Dom mow"* - replied Amir however he could - *"I cammot tee bell."*

*"You can't talk either bud. You better rest."* - answered Sam.

*"I guess we are, either at the end of the trial or at the gate before it ends"* - replied Hannah. Her eyes had rooted themselves firmly on the gate in front of her - *"This is the gate of the Wise."*

*"The last elder?"* - asked Sam in an attempt to follow Hannah's conversation.

Hannah nodded whilst she moved her arms to gently release Amir on his knees. Then, she walked to the gate to observe it up close.

The gate was the detailed rendition of a library, there was no single space in the gate in which you couldn't see the surface covered with book spines with various titles written on it such as: ‘Commuters of the lost Ark’, ‘Rise and fall of wonderful civilisations’, ‘Deadly Sins’, ‘Twenty-thousand leagues above the clouds’, ‘A guide for those expecting the unexpected’, ‘Lord of the annular metallic loops’, ‘Thief of time’, ‘Cats that may be dead or alive when placed in boxes, for dummies’, among many other titles.

The shelves of books covered every single inch of the gate, its centre was the one exception. In there, the sculpture of the Wise stood straight, her head slightly bowed down, her eyes closed and on her hands rested a lantern with six gems at each corner of the elongated hexagon encasing a crystal flame. The lantern itself had a surprising amount of detail.

The entire statue trapped in the gate looked somewhat alive if you ignored the fact that it was made out of white and grey stone.

Hannah's eyes browsed every book cover; she hoped it would make sense and tell her what to do next - *"Sam, have you found anything that resembles a clue?"*

Sam eyes travelled around the room, with the exception of the gate and the scary alley behind them, there was nothing else - *"Not really, no."*

Hannah's eyes got drawn to a book titled ‘What to do if you are left behind’, she wished she could read the contents of the book. Her hand hovered a second or two above it, she decided to continue looking around, eventually setting her analytical mind on the lantern the Wise was holding. She read the message hidden between the gems:

```
Sciential autumn scitote

Quia Universum

Sci te ipsum
```

*"Science is knowledge, the cosmos is knowledge, know yourself?"* - translated Hannah, mostly to herself though Sam overheard the words and didn't make any comment about it.

There was a ‘tchirck’ sound from the lantern, similar to a stick bursting in flames, which made Hannah step back a few metres. From there she could see the flame in the lantern flickered alive and glowed, it didn't seem to be made of crystal anymore but actual fire.

The Wise opened her eyes revealing two little golden stars shining light of the children.

*Who has awakened me from my slumber?* - echoed a female voice off the walls of the room.

Hannah saw the relief on the gate gaining depth, the lantern moved out of its stone frame, followed by the hands and the body of the Wise.

*I said, who has awakened me from my slumber?* - the voice resonated loudly in the confined space as a version of the Wise stood in front of the children. Her eyes swayed between all of them.

*"I did!"* - said Hannah, determined to conquest this new challenge.

The animated statue waved her hands mid air, it triggered a response on the sand which danced around the children before it enveloped the walls taking the shape of a library with a dozen lanterns hovering near the walls. The room had gone dark, just a few books could be seen in the gloom.

The ground below their feet crumbled away leaving small platforms on which Hannah, Sam and Amir stood on, connected by thin threaded filaments. If you were to watch at the scene from above, the children would be little bugs trapped on a spider web.

*Thus you shall answer my three questions. Answer correctly and I shall grant you passage.* - stated the voice.

*"What if I don't know the answer?"* - replied Hannah. She felt calmed, she had solved all the challenges so far.

*You have two chances to answer correctly. On the third, I shall consume you.* - replied the voice - *First question: What's represented by each Elder?*

Hannah turned to face Sam in an attempt to understand the quiz, he shrugged back - *"I don't know Hannah, what does the Elders look like?"*

Hannah paused a moment, thinking about the Elders and what they used to do on each of the realms.

She knew that every new child appeared in Dawn, which used to be overseen and guided by Father. He was a loving and caring figure to all those who descended from the sky.

The Prairie was protected by the Collector, the gentle giant fond of nature and live.

The Hidden Forest was protected by the Smith, a fearsome hardworking woman which could bent any element to her will.

The Valley of Triumph had the Twins. They competed day and night, they never took a moment to rest.

The ruins of the Golden City had the Warrior. Someone totally dedicated to protect his people no matter the cost.

And finally the Wise, she was the keeper of the knowledge of the previous civilisation.

*Do you have an answer?* - queried the voice as the statue pushed its face forward into the light. The two glowing orbs burnt intensively.

*"I think they are protection for their people and us?"* - answered Hannah.

The Wise eyes moved from Hannah to the boys behind her - *Wrong! Pick a sacrifice!*

*"What? Sacrifice? NO!"* - screamed Hannah. She desperately looked at Amir's feeble appearance then moved her gaze at Sam - *"Please! Don't!"*

The statue smiled and waved her hands - *It is done.*

The sound of crushing bones flooded the alley barely visible on the bookcase covered walls. Giant hairy legs appeared at the entrance of the room revealing a massive black spider as wide as the alley. It sprung from the edge of the alley onto the spider web structure and ran straight to Sam.

*"NO STOP IT! PLEASE! RUN SAM! RUN!"* - screamed Hannah.

He remained silent watching the monstrous critter approaching; terror flooded each fibre of his being. He turned to look at Hannah just before the spider pounced on him sticking its fangs deep in his neck. Black veins grew from Sam's neck, his face showed pain. The black veins slowly covered his entire body, paralysing him. A moment after, Sam was nothing more than a black statue resting on the spider web. The spider began threading silk around his body, making a cocoon.

The brief instants of silence after the attack were broken by Hannah's gasps; shock and sorrow had made her struggle for air.

*"Amma? Bhat-appemd?"* - said Amir. He tried to understand the world around him - *"Pam?"* 

Hannah couldn't bring herself to explain what just happened - *"Don't worry Amir."* - she said, battling her emotions to face the statue.

*"Was this what you meant with two chances?"* - she asked; anger and sorrow filled her up. She didn't want to complete the phrase ‘I would need to sacrifice my friends if I make mistakes?’

The Wise statue lower its hands then it faced Hannah inquiring with the same voice projected from every inch of the room, it was somehow louder - *I shall ask again, What's represented by each Elder?*

Hannah's felt the horrible pressure rising again.

*I stupidly assumed I knew the answers without thinking on the consequences* - she thought trying to gain some calm.

*I do not appreciate silence, child. State your answer or fail a second time* - said the voice filling up the room.

Hannah wiped her face in an attempt to think clearly, her eyes rested on one of the books she read before.

*Deadly Sins. The seven deadly sins. Seven!* - she thought.

*"Would they represent the seven virtues?"* - she asked tentatively.

*A question doesn't answer my question* - said the voice as the Wise remained observant of Hannah.

*"Yes, but you didn't say it was wrong! So, Father is patience, the Collector is charity, the Smith is... is... the Twins must be temperance and... and diligence! The Warrior is generosity... Then the Smith must be chastity and the Wise: humility."* - said Hannah expectant of what the statue of the Wise was going to do.

The two golden lights moved across the room and rested on Hannah - *Correct! Second question: Who am I?*

Hannah felt her flame sunk deep on her chest. She could imagine what would happen to Amir if she said something silly. She followed her thoughts - *I feel tempted to state the obvious, but it might be a trap.*

Hannah scrapped the bottom of her brain in an attempt to identify anything of the statue in front of her.

The black spider moved gently on the threads of the web, leaving a silk covered lump that Hannah's imagination assumed it was Sam's body, her believes wanted to have a different assumption. She felt totally overwhelmed,  her mind tried to follow all the recent events and the spider threw a new one to the stream when it began making its way towards Amir.

*Answer me, child. Who am I?* - said the voice projected from the walls.

Hannah's stress skyrocketed, her one thought at that moment was the spider intent to attack Amir.

The spider had positioned itself behind the unprotected Amir, who remained quiet on the platform trying to understand the world around him.

*No answer then!* - said the voice reverberating from the walls. The spider swayed its fangs up and down, ready to make a lunge on her new victim.

*"STOP!"* - said Hannah. Her thoughts rocking back and forth like a boat in the middle of a storm found themselves in the eye of the cyclone, calmness flowed in and she could sort a few events before she composed an answer - *"You can't be the Wise, the Wise was meant to be firm but never cruel! You must be the spider spirit. The owner of this maze! You are the black spider about to attack."*

*Oh? Fascinating* - said the voice - *What made you think that?*

*"I found strange the Wise moves and acts as if it is sentient, but the voice came from the shadows in the room. Then your voice became sharper and clearer the moment you stepped in the room."* - said Hannah in an attempt to reassure herself that was the right answer.

The statue of the Wise froze onsite, the two glowing orbs disappeared from its face. The statue released the lantern from its hands, tumbling down before it exploded as soon as it landed on the ground, the dust disappeared between the fibres of the spiderweb. Then the statue itself crumbled into a cloud of fine particles that vanished in the thin air.

Hannah turned around to face the black spider, it was right above Amir, its two frontal legs suspended in the middle of the air. It had a menacing stance. It became more menacing when eight glowing golden orbs signalling the position of its eyes peering at Hannah.

*Correct again!* - replied the spider. Its voice wasn't masked by the room anymore, it came from the spider itself - *I am the owner of the maze. The keeper of knowledge and devourer of lost souls. I am the judge of your future.*

*"I answered correctly just now, give me Sam back!"* - said Hannah. Her judgement had become clouded with her emotions and stress.

*HA! You have quite an entitled personality. But you do not make the rules here.* - said the spider with a hint of petulance - *Last question! What is your biggest fault?*

*"What?"* - replied Hannah.

*You heard me right. Any further words from you will be considered as your answer.* - stated the spider. Its fangs began to emit a black fluid. It made the fangs glistened in the poor light.

Hannah tried to analyse the question - *of course I know myself* - she thought in an attempt to calm herself down and find a better way to phrase her answer. She watched Amir laying on the patch, his eyes swollen and his face puffy due to the beating he received at the challenge of the Twins. He looked so helpless. Her memory made her remember the previous opportunities she didn't ask for help. Perhaps she had found her answer.

*"I've been too independent!"* - she said. She felt that was the right answer.

The spider remained silent an instant, its eight glowing orbs fixed on Hannah.

To Hannah, the next few instants felt like an eternity. She saw the black spider descending on Amir, burying her fangs deep in the powerless body; dark veins spread from the fangs swallowing whole Amir's body. The spider had turned Amir into another black statue.

Hannah felt like her legs' bones had suddenly vanished, gravity did its job and she dropped on the ground. A stream of tears rushed down her face.

*Wrong again little one. You are down to the last chance you have!* - said the spider, wrapping Amir's frozen body with a thick layer of pure white silk.

There was an Amir sized hole in Hannah's mind and heart. The little reason fighting to take control told her she should have enjoyed more of Amir's nuances, his almost inexhaustible sense of humour in adversity, his energy, his loving persona. She felt so much guilt, she let Sam and Amir down. She felt alone once more, like she had felt before she met the pair of friends. Hannah's anguish bounced back on her, turning some of the pain into regret and agony.

The stream of sentiments and tears could not be stopped, she just laid on the floor, collapsed in a sobbing little girl.

*Have you given up?* - said the spider moving closer to Hannah.

Hannah couldn't deviate her eyes towards the spider, her eyes were filled with tears either way.

*"Do what you must"* - said Hannah in between sobs - *"I thought, they needed me. I was so stupid, I needed them more."*

*Well child, you won't be lonely any more. You'll have my company for eternity.* - replied the spider taking its position in front of Hannah's dwindled figure. Its fangs rubbed against each other in anticipation of the attack.

*"I was too proud to recognise what I had"* - said Hannah.

The spider fangs froze in place - *You what?*

*"I was too proud! That was my biggest flaw. I was stupid and proud and I couldn't see it! I lost all my friends before and it happened once again... I am a stupid proud fool."* - said Hannah, she continued crying profusely.

All eight golden eyes rested on the diminished girl in front of the spider - *I'll take that as the answer!* - and the eight golden orbs bursted in light that showered Hannah.

The blackness covering the spider slowly retreated back, leaving an immobile sculpture of the monstrous critter, Hannah observed between sobs and frights.

A muffled sound of a beating heart shook the still spider body. A thud from within told Hannah something wanted to come out from the gigantic body.

She pushed herself as far away as she could from the critter, Hannah's world had stopped making sense since the spider attacked Amir.

A loud crack made her jolt on the spot. A pair of arms reached out from the spider's torso, followed by the womanly shape of the spirit, it was the lady wearing a spider mask; she rose from her spidery husk - *It is hard to recognise those characteristics in ourselves that cause us pain. With your newly gained knowledge I expect you to treat others as equals, to consult your doubts and fears, to follow the virtue of humility.*

The spirit extended her hand to Hannah. It contained a yellow beating flame.

*Take it. You are now a vessel of knowledge.* - said the spirit.

Hannah understood the trial was over, she wanted to feel relief but her heavy heart ached - *"What good is this now? I am alone again on this journey. I betrayed Sam; sacrificed him for my selfish reasons."*

She took a deep breath in an attempt to calm her self, her voice broke when Amir popped in her mind - *" I have lost someone I cared about deeply..."* - tears streamed down her face - *"I knew him for a short while but, I thought he may have been the love of my life..."*

*"Who's your what now?"* - said Amir's voice from behind the empty spider husk.

The spider lady smiled at Hannah and said - *Now you are true to yourself and true to others.*

*"I... I wonder if I should leave the room and go back to the maze. You know, give you some privacy!"* - said Sam with a hint of humour in his voice as his face popped from around the legs of the empty spider.

*"Huh? What is happening?"* - replied a confused Hannah. Her face started to burn red after she saw Amir blushed face pop into her view.

*The earth trial is over. Your friends have returned to their former selves.* - said the spirit waving her hands, returning the room to its original bland appearance.

Amir walked closer to Hannah and said shyly - *"You love me?"*

Hannah couldn't meet his eyes, instead she looked at his feet softly nodding. She felt naked under his inquisitive gaze - *"Never-ever-ever leave me alone, ok?"*

Amir was shocked, his face told Sam the thought ‘What should I do now?’ travelled his mind, but before Amir could decide what to do, Hannah jumped to hug him and squeezed tightly. He held her back, inundated with happiness. He mumbled to her ear - *"Ok, I won't."* - It was barely audible to Sam.

*"Hem! Ahem hem!"* - said Sam clearing his throat - *"Very moving and all but, could we do this outside? I had enough of this maze."*

Hannah squeezed the yellow light between her fingers. It burst enveloping the children in warmth and a peacefully melting feeling. Hannah blinked reflexively the instant the flash grew, when she opened it again, she laid on the floor next to Amir, holding his hand, surrounded by the flickering light of candles dancing to an inaudible tune. The children had returned to the cave.

Hannah didn't know what the future was going to be like, but she knew she was not going to let go of that hand holding her gently but firmly.

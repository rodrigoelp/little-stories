# Restless expectancy

Yule had counted every single water lily drifting aimlessly on the pond. She had categorised them by colours, numbers of petals and strength of its fragrance. She felt slightly interested on the arrangement the plants had taken, the red and yellow ones migrated to the southwest whilst the white and blue ones remained on its northeast side of the pond.

*Should I sort the koi fish based not he patterns on their back* - thought Yule trying to fight the intense feeling of boredom and anxiety.

*It's all Mathias' fault! He made me aware they haven't come out and Paul made it all worse.* - She thought impatiently - *And that spirit... Virgil left me all alone!*

The thought ‘all alone’ resonated in her head - *Perhaps I could venture to take a stroll; check what is going on just in case one of the spirit has... ARGH! Paul, why did you have to put these thoughts in my head?*

Yule checked her surroundings; not even the clouds made a movement. She checked the palm of her hand, expecting pulsating shadows, she wanted to know if certain spirit continued his celestial discussions with the nearest star, the stream of sunlight gently warmed her hand without pulses, glimmers and definitely not a single tinkles - *"Mr... Virgil?"*

She waited for the ephemeral response that never came back.

Once again Yule felt the need to rush towards the cave. She dried her feet and walked furtively across the garden and into the hall of the large yet empty temple. She remembered the first time walking down the temple, she felt in awe due to its dimensions, the slightly worn yet delightfully cut granite cobbles decorated most of the floors. Every detail was perfectly visible despite the fact that direct sunlight couldn't reach the inner chambers of the temple, it had been designed in a way the light, as soft as the plumage of a baby bird, it made it to the inner chambers; giving off a welcoming and imposing feeling, which is a really hard thing to do given the two words oppose each other.

*Ah, it still has that distracting effect* - she thought, recovering her standing to follow on her secretive endeavour.

A gentle breeze made the tip of the ever-going candle lights sway back and forth. She froze in the spot, methodically studying each shadow - *That spirit is always so cheeky. I wished I had the skill of going through walls like he does.*

She waited a few moments before resuming her careful steps, not to trigger a single sound to absent ears. If anybody would to observe her from the most obscure sections of the temple, they would feel quite impressed at the little girl with her bright pink cape covered in feathers, primarily due to the lack of any sound, followed by her swiftness and discreetness.

She reached the entrance to the temple, checked a few times in all directions. No pesky spirits here either. She turned around the corner and began to walk towards one of the entrances to the cave of prophecies.

*"They might be about to be done"* - said a familiar voice, watching the little girl slipping away into the shadows.

*Dang it!* - she thought.

*"But you are free to continue your clandestine plan to review the state of the precious children under my care"* - added Virgil, sitting on a bench a far bit away from the entrance.

*"So, you watched all that, huh?"* - added Yule, her cheeks had turned a shade of pink as she felt slightly embarrassed.

*"Did I watch all of it? In a way, yes I did"* - he replied - *"It was quite amusing how you walked on the tip of your toes; very enjoyable."*

*"Why didn't you answer my call?"* - she said as closing in to the spirit.

*"You mean, the call to verify if you were going to be caught?"* - said Virgil in an attempt to not embarrass Yule even further, but he failed at it - *"I am curious about Sam as well."*

*"I am curious about all of them!"* - said Yule; it had the stench of a cheap excuse.

*"Sure; all of them, one of them"* - said Virgil started to look at his celestial companion - *"Numbers are relative used to say a merchant friend of mine; albeit, he used it to explain to others why he kept their change."*

Virgil enjoyed smiling, it was a foreign concept he had grown used to - *"You can go, I'll be working on my tanning skills."*

*"I thought the dead cannot tan"* - added Yule. The bright reflection of the extremely pale apparition in front of her indicated he needed lots of practice with these tanning sessions. His skin colour, slightly white cream colour, screamed there was not much pigment to work on either way.

*"It is true the dead cannot tan, but who said I couldn't?"* - said Virgil admiring incredibly small particles deflecting and diffusing its energy, turning blue in the process - *"Either way, such a question could take a long time to answer. In the meantime, you should proceed onto your endeavours. I'll continue to work on the colouration of the immaterial and incorporeal."*

Yule had so many questions for him. Questions about the past and the future, but right now, she felt it was better to leave them unanswered and headed into the cave.

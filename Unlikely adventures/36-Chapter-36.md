# Restless expectancy

Yule had counted every single water lily drifting aimlessly on the pond. She came up with a categorisation based on colours, numbers of petals and strength of its fragrance. She felt slightly interested on the arrangement the plants had taken, the red and yellow ones migrated to the southwest whilst the white and blue ones remained on its northeast side of the pond.

*Should I sort the koi fish based not he patterns on their back* - thought Yule trying to fight the intense feeling of boredom and anxiety.

*It's all Mathias' fault! He made me aware they haven't come out and Paul made it all worst.* - She continued trying to blame her current state of impatience - *And that spirit left me all alone!*

The thought ‘all alone’ resonated in her head - *Perhaps I could venture for a little bit, check what is going on and come out. ARGH! Paul, why did you have to put these thoughts in my head?*

Yule checked her surroundings; not even the clouds made a movement. She checked the palm of her hand, she wanted to know if certain spirit continued his celestial discussions with the nearest star, the stream of sunlight gently warmed her hand, no pulses, no glimmers and definitely not a single tinkles - *"Mr... Virgil?"*

She waited for the ephemeral response that never came back.

Once again Yule felt the need to rush towards the cave. She dried her feet and walked furtively across the garden and into the hall of the large yet empty temple. She remembered the first time walking down the temple, she felt in awe due to its dimensions, the slightly worn yet delightfully cut granite cobbles decorated most of the floors. No detail was missed despite the fact direct sunlight couldn't reach the inner chambers of the temple, it had been designed in a way that the light was as soft as the plumage of a baby bird; it made it feel welcoming and imposing, which is a really hard thing to do.

*Ah, it still has that distracting effect* - she thought and pressed herself to continue her secretive endeavour.

A gentle breeze made the tip of the ever-going candle lights. She froze in the spot - *That spirit is always so cheeky. I wished I had the skill of going through walls like he does.*

She waited a few moments before resuming her careful steps, not to trigger a single sound to absent ears. If anybody would to observe her from the most obscure sections of the temple, they would feel quite impressed at the little girl with her bright pink cape covered in feathers, primarily due to the lack of any sound.

She reached the entrance to the temple, checked a few times in all directions. No pesky spirits here either. She turned around the corner and began walking towards one of the entrance to the cave.

*"They might be about to be done"* - said a familiar voice, observing the little girl slipping away.

*Dang it!* - she thought.

*"But you are free to continue your clandestine plan to review the state of the precious children under my care"* - added Virgil, slitted a far bit away from the entrance.

*"So, you watched all that, huh?"* - added Yule, her cheeks had turned a shade of pink as she felt slightly embarrassed.

*"Did I watch all of it? In a way, yes I did"* - he replied - *"It was quite amusing to be honest."*

*"Why didn't you answer my call?"* - she said as closing in to the spirit.

*"You mean the call to verify if you were going to be caught?"* - said Virgil in an attempt to not embarrass Yule even further, but he failed at it - *"I am curious about Sam as well."*

*"I am curious about all of them!"* - said Yule; it had the stench of a cheap excuse.

*"Sure; all of them, one of them. Numbers are relative."* - said Virgil started to look at his celestial companion.

*"I think I'll work on my tanning skills"* - he added.

*"I thought the dead cannot tan"* - added Yule. The bright reflection of the extremely pale apparition in front of her indicated he wasn't used to these tanning sessions. There was something about that slightly white cream colour screaming the almost total absence of pigment on his intangible constitution.

*"It is true the dead cannot tan, but who said I couldn't?"* - said Virgil admiring incredibly small particles deflecting and diffusing its energy, turning blue in the process - *"Either way, such a question could take a long time to answer. In the meantime, you should proceed onto your endeavours. I'll continue to work on the tanning of the immaterial and incorporeal."*

Yule paused staring at the spirit. She had so many questions. Questions about the past and the future, but right now, she felt it was better to leave them unanswered and headed into the cave.

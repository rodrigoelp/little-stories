# Fair compensation

Amir sat on the floor as he resentfully observed the wall - *"What now?"* - he added, still rubbing his head.

*"Well, this is a dead end. We looked around the corner the path just stops"* - said Sam, helpfully stating what the other two already knew but, perhaps, an invisible entity didn't.

*"We might need to go back, east of the gates. Where the gap is"* - said Hannah - *"at least there, we could see a path we could follow."*

*"Two paths to follow, one forward if we are lucky. One downwards if we aren't"* - said Amir arse-wisely.

Hannah gave Amir a somewhat disappointed look - *"Let's figure out what to do."* - she said.

*"What if we fall?"* - asked Sam doubtfully.

She didn't answer. That was a question she didn't want to find an answer to.

They walked in silence as they approached the gap.

*"Could you stand still? Please?"* - pleaded Hannah.

The boulders obeyed and arranged itself  as a ladder for the children to go by.

Sam looked apprehensively to the blackness below - *"(Gulp!)"*

The loud noise made by Sam's throat surprised Hannah, it felt a bit cartoonish yet the sensation was interrupted, as a blurred version of Amir went past them at full speed.

Amir had jumped from the edge of the corridor onto the first boulder and, without losing any momentum, his legs stretched to reach the final two boulders and finally, the opposite side of the gap. It took three large steps.

*Maybe he is part goat* - thought Sam remembering Hannah's previous comments.

Hannah felt infused with confidence seeing Amir achieving his goal so easily and ventured next. She carefully tested the rigidity of each bounder as she set foot on each one. The first two bounders were the hardest, partly due to the expectation of the unexpected, but, as she reached the third boulder, she saw an open arms Amir waiting for her. She just hopped into the embracing warmth.

*"Th... Thanks!"* - she said softly baring her face into Amir's chest. The tender moment was interrupted by Amir's personality.

*"WHAT THE BLOODY-ELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR, SAM?"* - screamed Amir.

Sam felt his stomach clenching.

Nervousness ran through his brain.

He took a deep breath fighting his racing brain, as if more air was going to make the whole process easier. Shook his head side to side and stepped back two or three metres from the edge before launching himself forward, running at full speed.

*"What is he doing? You don't need to sprint!"* - said Amir to Hannah.

Sam jumped about a metre from the edge, landing hard with both feet on the first boulder. His feet skidded as the loose sand gave out under the pressure of the arrival. He fought to maintain the balance. He jumped at the last moment before falling towards the second boulder, the story repeated itself. His feet lost the grip required to stop on the second boulder, his arms swayed uncontrollably in an attempt to gain balance and a new jump was made towards the third boulder.

The third landing, if that could be called landing, consisted on Sam landing with one foot sidewise and one other leg up in the air. By now, he was doing a great impression of a man at a circus, walking the loose rope and about to fall.

Pain shoot up from his ankle as the leg gave up the fight between the forces at play. The pain told him gravity was sure to win. His brain told him to close his eyes and wait for the worst. Unconsciously, he extended his arms.

*"I got you buddy!"* - said Amir, laying on the floor holding Sam's hands. Sam swung gently with emptiness below his feet. A few pebbles dislodged by the sudden set of movements, fell into the void.

As Sam observed the pebbles venture deeper into the unknown, he saw them exploding into fine particles, just like a ball of sand would do when you hit it with a hammer.

*"Amir! Don't let go!"* - said Sam, terror filling every gap of the sentence - *"Please! Please! Don't let go!"*

Hannah grabbed Amir's waist and gave him a reassuring signal that she had him gripped tight. To the count of three, they pulled Sam up.

Sam's flame beat with such force, his entire body moved as his chest glowed. He remained with his eyes closed.

*This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real* - he thought repeatedly to himself.

*"Sam, are you ok?"* - Hannah asked tentatively to Sam as he recovered the pacing of his breathing.

*"Yes... fine... sorry about that"* - he added a little self absorbed on what could have happened if Amir wouldn't have caught him - *"Let's continue, ok?"*

*"It's all good buddy!"* - said Amir beaming with happiness - *"When I saw you jumping like ‘flummm!’ I thought ‘no way!’ And jumped in like ‘swoom!’ And you were like..."*

*"Enough Amir!"* - interrupted Hannah as she noticed Sam filled with stress.

Amir felt another look filled with disapprobation and decided it was best to pick up Sam and follow Hannah.

The path ahead was uneventful, the corridor undulated gently as it curved softly towards the north. They walked several metres more, went past more 'fake' windows as they grew increasingly disoriented. Amir's focus on Sam was interrupted by Hannah running further ahead.

*"There's a gate!"* - she said.

The corridor ended on a almost pure white sandstone gate, decorated with eight gems, resembling a shepherd's crook. The crook's gems gave off a eery pale blue light and the stone around these was sculpted magnificently to highlight the shape drawn by the gems.

*"Father's constellation"* - said Hannah, recognising the pattern.

*"Wait! Who's father? Do you have a father?"* - answered Amir with a hint of anxiety in his voice as he tried to get his messy hair back in a presentable form.

*"Not my father, everybody's father"* - she replied in an attempt to clarify, though it backfired; she noticed Amir distancing from her - *"Father is the name of one of the elders."*

*"Ah, phew!"* - said Amir relieved - *"You got me there for a sec!"*

Sam ignored part of the conversation, mesmerised by the composition and the lack of texture on the gate. The eight gems were made of quartz tightly compacted into gems with an inner glow giving off the vibe that little stars were captured in it. The grain of the gate was different to the walls, whilst the walls had a roughness to it, the gate was perfectly smooth.

*"What does it say down there?"* - asked Hannah pointing to some engraving below Sam's hand. Sam felt like the engraving wasn't there just an instant ago.



```
A warrior found two shepherds making bread, one of them had three loaves and the other, five loaves. They agree to share the food.

After they had eaten, the warrior gave eight gems as a payment for his meal.

How should the shepherds fairly divide the the payment?
```



They all read the message, it required some thinking. Sam felt his brain wasn't right to solve this and looked optimistically to Amir.

Amir read once more the engraving. He seemed deep in thoughts solving complex equations. He finally said - *"Who's the better baker?"*

*"What?"* - replied Hannah thrown off by the impromptu comment - *"Why does that matter?"*

*"Well, I don't know about you, but, I wouldn't pay good money for bad bread"* - replied Amir - *"What if the other shepherd had five loaves because he is a bad cook and no-one wants to eat that bread? I just think it is suspicious they have so much bread laying around."*

Hannah observed him in disbelief, opening and closing her mouth trying to make an argument to his reply. Finally, she exhaled in an attempt to let go a bad memory and said - *"The answer should be, the first shepherd should receive one gem, the other seven."*

The glowing crook changed colour to a warm golden light as the gate swung open.

*"How did you know?"* - asked Sam, impressed by Hannah's wit.

*"If they all ate the same amount, the first Shepard had to give one-third of one of his loaves, the other shepherd had to give two loaves and one-third to the warrior. Two loaves equals six-thirds. One vs Seven."* - she explained rationally as she walked past the gate and started observing the changes on the new corridor.

*"... seven gems for bread nobody wanted to eat. What a rip off! What a rip off!"* - lamented Amir shaking his head.

Hannah ignored him.

The gate closed behind them, the glowing stars slowly faded away leaving the glassy shape behind.

*"I guess, the maze is one-way only, huh?"* - remarked Hannah.

The children's eyes inspected their new environment.

The corridor wasn't that much different to the previous one. Perhaps, it featured a lot less fake windows and it was less tidy. The ground was littered with debris laying around and the sand had a coarser feel to it. One obvious difference in this corridor was its noticeable tilt towards one particular side.

Sam's eyes travelled across multiple details on the walls.

Amir continued his monologue about quantitive appreciation of baked goods.

Hannah's gaze ran through the length of the corridor and decided, it was time to start moving. She started walking absent-mindedly in an attempt to figure out the path to take.

Sam followed her feeling a bit unstable. He had recovered his composure but the grains of sand made him skid, missing one or two steps.

*"... Quality over quantity, you know? That's what I am saying. I am sure that little bit of bread was so much better than... oi!"* - continued Amir lost in his internal discussion, when he noticed his companions a fair way down the corridor.

Amir rushed to catch up with his friends - *"Oi! Wait for me! Woah-oh-oh-waaaaah!"* - but the loose sand made him fall and slowly but surely he gained speed as the ground became more tilted.

First he bumped into Sam, who also lost his standing and became part of the rolling mass of children slipping down the narrow way. Then the commotion of legs reached Hannah, who involuntarily joined them as they descended out of control.

*"Hold onto anything!"* - she yelled.

Amir's arms extended out of the bundle holding onto Hannah.

*"... No! Amir, do not hold onto me! Onto something else!"* - she yelled irritated.

Sam stretched out his arms, digging his fingers in the sand in an attempt to slow down. It didn't work. Every rock they bumped into got dislodged and burst into powder - *"I... I can't grab anything!"* - he yelled.

*"Grab onto anything!"* - yelled Hannah - *"A rock! A crack! A branch! Anything!"*

*"There are no trees here! Just sand, sandstone, and more sand!"* - argued Amir, unhelpfully and they continued rolling towards the now clear end of the road.

*"That's not the point! I meant that I wished there was anything I can grab onto!"* - replied Hannah.

As if commanded, the sand rolling with them clumped together and anchored itself on the ground as Hannah's free hand went past. The children had come to a stop just a few metres away from the edge of the corridor which would have resulted on all three falling to the abyss below.

The children remained on the floor, panting and tired.

The sound of balls of sand exploding echoed against the walls, as a reminder to the children, about what would happen if they have hurried towards the vast emptiness.

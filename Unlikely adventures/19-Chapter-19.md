# Mindful shaping

Sam and Amir observed the gate they had left behind; the glowing gems cast the last few pulses before its light faded out, leaving the tiny afterglow in the otherwise dark stones.

Invisible gears engaged in motion to shut the gate close behind the children.

*"Let's keep moving"* - said Hannah monotonically. There was a hint of fatigue in her voice, the maze drained her off her good mood. She watched briefly the two boys and steered right as she stepped deeper into the unknown corridor.

Sam's eyes browsed the edges of the walls and found the spidery decoration heading left.

*"Maybe we should go the other way."* - he stated without explaining his motives.

Hannah gave a doubtful look to his suggestion, the passage seemed awfully unused and unattended - *"Sam, I got a gut feeling we should head down to the right."* - she said firmly.

*"Come on, let's go!"* - she added ignoring Sam's subtle messaging.

*"But, I really think we should go on this path... Hannah?"* - said Sam as the shape of Hannah disappeared down the path she chose. Sam shook his head and gave a complicit look to Amir - *"We shouldn't argue with her today, huh?"*

Sam's snarky comment wasn't met with the expected response. Amir remained silent.

*"(Sigh)... let's go buddy."* - added Sam, gently pulling Amir's arm as they followed Hannah.

It was hard to judge how long they have been walking in the maze, the black sky gave no indication of the passage of time; boredom was their only measurement at hand. Hannah felt the pressure of leading the boys through the maze, she felt the responsibility of having solved two of the puzzles. She was painfully aware of Amir's uncharacteristic quietness and lack of humour. She wanted to prove herself that she doesn't need help from others and she is a good addition to Sam's and Amir's partnership.

She walked every corridor followed by Sam and an Amir who has been, almost literally, dragged by Sam the whole way. She knew they were lost, she didn't want to admit it.

Time continued its unstoppable passage. In an attempt to figure out which corridors they had walked already, Hannah came up with a system in which, she would push a few fists of sand next to the corner's edge, before they all turned. That way, she would leave behind a marker and recognise a used path. Little did she know, the sand didn't like their new arrangement and returned slowly to its original location as soon as the children were off its sight.

Every new passage they turned into, Sam focused on the numerous spiders they have gone past. Somehow he knew they were going in circles; he had come to recognise the shape and size of spiders of every "new" corridor.

Hannah turned right once more and felt excitement as she got close to a gate -*"Hah! Finally! This is the gate of..."* - said Hannah slowly losing hopes as her eyes recognised the pattern the gems drawn on the gate - *"the Collector."*

Sam remained silent with his mind preoccupied with Amir's utter silence - *"Hey bud, should I tell her I sort of, kind of, maybe I understand the maze?"*

He watched Amir's mindless shrug, followed by an inspection of Hannah's location. She had marched down left of the gate.

Sam gave up on trying to reanimate his now zombie companion. He looked up to the walls and said - *"At least we are on the right path."*

Sam felt Hannah wasn't listening to his arguments, which was true. This was partly due to the fact, Hannah's mind was busy churning the intricate art of self recognition, but Sam was struggled to clearly say what was in his mind.

As they progressed through the maze, Sam decided to practice the art of delicately guiding someone who doesn't want to be guided by planting the seed of an idea that eventually will sprout on his victim, or should he say, companion. He didn't like the manipulative tactic but, he had walked by the same corner one too many times.

*"Uhm"* - said Hannah thoughtfully as she stood on another bifurcation - *"The one to the right seems scary, let's take the one on the left."*

*"The left one it is!"* - said Sam supportively whilst still observing a stream of spiders traveling towards the passage to his right - *"though, I remember distinctively a few turns back you said we found the last gate on the darkest corridor; perhaps this time it is hidden on the bright one!"*

*"Wait... When did I say that?"* - asked Hannah. There was a hint of doubt in her mind, Sam knew there was a hint of it and he needed to exploit it.

*"I thought you did. Maybe I misremembered. Shall we head to the left one then?"* - stated Sam brightly.

*"Yes, I think so"* - replied Hannah.

*"Great! You're the leader, though let's walk a bit slower"* - stated Sam.

*"Yes! Let's! Wait, why? Why do we need to walk slower?"* - asked Hannah.

*"Well, I think the corridor here is inclined and the sand is exactly like when we fell... almost to our deaths, but, it is just my impression. You are the boss!"* - said Sam, walking ahead whilst acting as if the ground was slippery.

*"Right... Sam?"* - began Hannah.

Sam read perfectly the tone of doubt in Hannah's voice - *"Wow! Wow! Almost felt there. Yeah?"*

*"I... would it be ok if we check the dark path first? If it is another dead end, we will mark it off. Ok?"* - she said as she turned around signalling Amir to turn around and follow her.

Sam knew this charade wasn't going to last long; Hannah was a clever girl and soon enough she was going to realise what he was doing. He felt evil tricking Hannah with such devious behaviour, but he had found a way to help and he wasn't going to let it go to waste.

He followed her providing commentary as they walked along deeper into the maze.

Hannah's eyes opened wide as she the deep long passage opened up to a large big hall without a roof. The hall was totally empty, devoid of any meaningful feature other than four walls and a gate with rounded top. It was made out of solid sandstone, ten glowing gems drawing a hammer and an anvil. They had found the gate of the smith.

She ran closer to it, in an attempt to decipher the new puzzle ahead and immediately noticed its differences in comparison to the previous two.

She remembered the Father's gate. It seemed to have done with a lot of effort. It was sculpted delicately out of the sandstone, removing everything that wasn't necessary but the shepherd's crook. The gate lacked features beside the shepherd's crook, just pure white sandstone, it was a beautiful and sophisticated.

The Collector's gate was extremely simple. Its smooth surface lacked any relief or carving. It was a slab of pure white sandstone featuring the gems drawing the vase constellation. It looked innocent like the drawing of a child on a white piece of paper.

As she observed in detail the Smith's gate, she could say it was overcomplicated, hard to describe with few words. Its appearance could only be described as if an engineer was assigned to provide a design for it without too many directions other than ‘she enjoys big mechanical artefacts’ and, perhaps, the gate needed to be future proofed in case requirements had to be changed because ‘You never know! We may want the gates to spin up and sideways. Maybe we want it to run perpendicular to seven parallel lines (parallel to each other)’ and the engineer just ran crazy with that idea.

The edges of the gate had a series of carved gears, hinges and winches, all connected with each other. Inwards, the gears were slowly replaced by a different set of machinery, wrenches, bolts and screws right up to the point the anvil and the hammer where located.

There, instead of a smooth texture highlighting the gems contained by the constellation, the artist decided to frame each gem with a set of hinged rotating panels connected on one of the edges, letting light to sip in, like a camera shutter hidden behind a lens.

Finally, observed Hannah, the gate's sandstone was jagged and its colour far from the pure white as the previous gates; it gave off a metallic appearance from afar but from this distance she could see the grains trapped in the stone. The quartz in the stone had been compressed to a scaly shape, bouncing off any light with a dirty-silvery-greyish hue.

Hannah could only think of the gate as elaborate, over-engineer, overloaded, oversaturated, overcomplicated and all over the place. She continued examined the door and all its details.

*"The room is totally empty"* - observed Sam - *" Should we look for clues about what do to now?"*

*"Probably"* - replied Hannah still entranced with the labour put on this gate.

*"But an empty room shouldn't have much to..."* - said Hannah pausing the sentence as she turned around to face Sam and Amir - *"... say. Why can't I remember that bench, Amir?"*

Sam turned around and saw Amir comfortably sitting on a long sandstone bench facing the gate.

*"I don't know. I felt tired and wanted to take a sit. The bench was there."* - replied Amir, his voice sounded hoarse as sounds travelled up his throat for the first time in a while.

*"The bench was **just** there?"* - queried Hannah once more. Her tone was sharp as she tried to understand how they went past the object without noticing it.

Amir felt the question was an objection to his comfort and stood up - *"I'm sorry, don't get mad, ok?"* - he added as the solid bench behind him broke down into a fine powder and vanished without leaving any trace of its existence.

*"Wait! How did you do that?"* - she asked filled with astonishment.

*"Do what?"* - replied a very confused Amir.

*"The bench! It is gone!"* - she stated pointing with her finger to the location the bench used to be.

Amir turned around, saw the empty space and said - *"Huh!?"* - He scratched his head trying to comprehend what had happened to the bench.

*"Could you tell me, slowly, what happened when we came into this hall"* - Hannah said slowly and calmly in the same tone as you would use to address a frightful fawn.

*"You and Sam walked in, I saw the massive place and thought it looks like an empty chapel without a roof, then I thought I don't know what a chapel is. Then, I thought on how useless I am and wanted to lay down for a bit..."* - explained Amir. Fascinatingly, as he provided the commentary of his explanation, his background slowly changed to fit perfectly his imagination. For an instant, a set of curved ceiling ribs appeared behind Amir, giving the hall a beautiful flitting complexion that vanished as quickly as it has materialised, then several rows of benches materialised from the ground and sunk back into the ground leaving a single bench behind - *"... and I leaned back like this to rest and... Oh! The bench is back!"*

She looked at Amir as a child would watch a magician who just made cards disappear in the thin air - *"Could you show me how you did that?"* - she asked.

*"I am not doing anything!"* - replied Amir excusing himself - *"I swear, I am not doing anything!"*

Amir looked anxiously from Hannah to Sam and back.

Sam tried to mask his obvious state of awe and said - *"Wh... wha... where... wha... how?"* - he clearly failed at it.

Hannah remained silent in an attempt to comprehend the latest series of events. She turned around to face Sam and asked him - *"Quickly! Think about a fish tank"*

Sam gave her a puzzled look - *"Huh? What now?"* - his brain struggled to come back to this reality.

*"Close your eyes, imagine a fish tank!"* - she said firmly.

Sam looked at Amir's expression, they both were puzzled and confused but, he decided to close his eyes and imagine a large round jar filled with water and a fish swimming in it. He waited until the image was replaced in his head with what their friends might be expecting it would happen. He opened his eyes again and found Hannah with a disappointed expression.

*"And... what was the point of that?"* - asked Sam.

 *"I was testing a hypothesis"* - she replied dismissively, turning to look at Amir. He stared back at her whilst sitting on a bench with a glass cube resting next to him and a solid sand fish with little sand bubbles frozen in time. She smiled and pointed to the fish tank.

Amir followed the indicative finger and stood perplexed at the sculpture - *"Wow, that's amazing Sam! It looks just like I imagined it would look like!"* - he said.

*"That's not how I imagined it"* - clarified Sam.

Both kids turned to look inquisitively at Hannah.

*"My turn!"* - she said as she closed her eyes trying to imagine a patch of grass with lots of flowers in it, she opened her eyes and nothing. Just the hall filled with benches and one glass fish tank.

*"Uhm, clearly it doesn't respond to Sam's imagination or mine... But I swear it made the handle just like I wanted it when we slid down the corridor..."* - she explained, mostly to herself or to her audience trying to understand her last few actions.

*"Amir, What are you thinking right now?"* - she asked inquisitively.

*"Huh, nothing."* - replied Amir.

*"What about if I say I want to see a tree!"* - she asked with intrigue.

The empty space behind Amir's bench felt the strength of a silent tornado of sand that reformed in a tall maple tree with a swing hanging off one of its branches and a statue of Hannah staring at it. The statue wore a long strapless dress and a crown of glass daisy flowers over her head. Her hair was neatly tied in a ponytail. The dress was adorned with infinite crystals making her glow as light bounced off her. Waves of crystal daisies sprouted around her, every single one watched her as she watched the tree. 

Sam could see from the distance the statue was a very precise and faithful representation of the Hannah standing next to him - *"Oi, bud!"* - he followed pointing to the tree behind Amir.

Amir turned around and as surprise dawned on him having his thoughts revealed in such a manner, the entire sculpture collapsed in a cloud of fine particles. Feeling exposed and blushing, Amir turned slowly to face Hannah, just to find her completely flustered.

*"I... I'm sorry"* - he replied.

She took a few steps towards Amir and gave him a big hug - *"Thanks! That was... I am glad you are talking again."* - she said with her voice muffled as she dug her face deeper in Amir's chest.

*"OK!"* - she said turning around and taking a deep breath - *"back to the gate! How could we find a clue to help us open the gate?"*

They all stared at the gate, getting interrupted by the snap of Sam's fingers. An idea had formed in his mind.

*"Could you point to the clue?"* - said Sam to Amir.

*"What do you mean? I don't know where the clue might be!"* - replied a confused Amir. The world had stopped making sense for him these past few hours.

*"What if there is a giant arrow pointing to the clue in this room?"* - said Sam with a hint of maniacal intent.

The fine powder of the floor danced gently as Amir thought about it, taking the shape of an arrow pointing to the gate.

Sam looked at the arrow and its target. He felt Amir didn't understand the question and rephrased it - *"No Amir, I want the arrow to tell me where the clue is!"*

The fine powder disassembled, danced for a second and took the exact same shape and direction as it did before.

*"I think it is telling us the clue might be on the gate itself"* - clarified Hannah as she walked closer to the gate. The attention to detail on the gate was amazing. From up close she noticed the gears were connected to other gears, suspended by little springs which absorbed any vibration if these were to move.

*"Pfff"* - she exhaled finding the extremely little details ridiculous - *"Even though it is a gate made out of stone they built it as if the machinery would work... though, it seems to be missing a lever here."*

*"What's a lever?"* - asked Amir.

*"It is a beam, a stick resting or connected on its side to a nut so you can lift something heavy with little effort."* - she explained letting her engineering brain run wild.

*"Amir, show us where the lever is!"* - commanded Sam with enthusiasm.

Amir thought for a second; the sand danced for an instant, then collapsed on the ground. Nothing happened.

*"Maybe there isn't a lever here"* - replied Amir.

*"That's inconvenient"* - said Hannah getting a little disappointed - *"I was hoping there was a way I could fix it."*

The fine powder started to dance again between Hannah's feet. She stepped back, pushed away by the cloud of powder which took shape, revealing a Hannah statue holding a screwdriver on one hand and a lever on the other. The statue wore an overall and a tools belt hanging off her waist. Her head was covered with a bandana and, over one eye, a magnifying glass monocle. From up close, Sam observed the statue even had small patches the sand had a different orientation covering her face, like freckles. He gazed back at the original Hannah, every single freckle was matched with those on the statue.

*"Stop ogling her"* - said Amir with a hint of jealousy. Amir extended his hand to grab the missing part and handed it to Hannah - *"Is this what you needed?"*

She nodded, again, her face glowed red. She gently took the lever from Amir's hand and placed it in position on the gate. A twinkle shone through the machinery as the gears swung into action, hinges swivelled, pulleys got pulled and the shutter like mechanism adjusted, refining the light getting trapped by the gems until all ten glowed with a golden light. The gate moved sidewise letting the children walk into yet another corridor.

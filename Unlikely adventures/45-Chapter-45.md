# Deaf ears

The dust stopped snowing down onto the once immaculate floor of the temple, noticed Virgil. As an isolated event, it was fascinating to watch the particles slowly drift through the dense magical field permeating the air in the temple, you could brew a coffee and drink it before it fully settled, or the way previous scholars used to write it in the books ‘The generational study of the gravitational field of Dawn's temple had significant challenges. The most significant is the observant's lifespan.’

Either way, Virgil wasn't in the temple to be awe struck by falling dust, or the most current state: resting; he had come to set the record straight with one exasperating spirit.

You could say Virgil strolled deeper into the main hall towards its centre, others would have said it was an intentionally careful amble, but the most observant of the spectators would have noticed Virgil becoming slightly more tangible.

Every new step averted debris on the floor, it bothered him. Ever since he had memory, which can only be measured in cosmic scales, he had been drawn towards the order of things. The untidiness triggered his obsessive compulsion, forcing his arms up in preparation to conduct an orchestra through a beautiful melody, first slowly and methodical.

Then his palms swoop down and back up, repeatedly, as if he listened a composition made for violins, resembling the aggressiveness of intense summer heatwaves, blazing through the days, easing out with the sporadic shower; replaced by the cool and refreshing breeze brought by rainy days announcing the upcoming arrival of autumn.

Every stroke of his arm flared waves of motion on the ground, or shall we say, commotion on the ground as objects, detritus and dust sparked up with life.

Collapsed bookshelves straightened out, separating between one another.

Books flew off from their disarrayed stupor onto a vacant bookshelf, exposing their titles with their goldenly labelled spines.

Shattered cups recomposed into their former shape, returning to their silver plates, hoping for a future tea break.

Jars, candles, reading stands, ladders, and other artefacts returned to their appropriate location out of fear of being accused of disorderly behaviour.

The splinters littering the floor danced midair with the dust, silently arguing who needed to go where. It was best to avoid Virgil's stare so they agreed to get out of their way and sort things after.

The hall cleaned itself, proverbially speaking as Virgil extended his arm, finishing the concerto with a lingering note.

*What a relaxing feeling* - he thought inspecting his work. The entire building had been tidied up and now he could focus on the throne in the middle of the hall, one sculpted out of white marble where the crest decorating the top rail reminisced Father's stylised appearance.

He fixated his bright blue eyes, burning like two distant young stars, onto the yellow gems decorating the face on the throne. Even though he remained motionless, you could feel the tension building up, almost as if Virgil tried to force the mineral crystal into submission.

The two gemstones sparked in flames.

*"I believe this must be working and you are listening"* - he said calmly to the entity starting at him on the other side of the magical gems - *"I wonder if you are asking how is it possible I reached to you. Do not try to reply, it would be wasted effort, I can't hear you... and it will facilitate the communication of my message. I do not appreciate others meddling with my work."*

Virgil had a calming voice, but it was threatening - *"I assume the child has taken your staff and it is masking its essence. I do not mind him carrying it around but I do not need supervision, and lack appreciation to be micromanaged. I will say it once and only once..."*

His bright blue eyes flared up with such intensity that for an instant, and only for an instant, the silhouette of his mask had very grim undertones - *"Do not get in my way or take the staff back."*

The bright blue light bathing the throne dwindled and faded away.

*"Before I go, I forgot to mention how much I like your place. It has a good atmosphere though my choice of colours doesn't quite align with yours, it seems... yours is a little too, lively for my taste"* - said Virgil's voice as his corporeal representation disappeared off the carefully cut gemstone on Father's lap. He gulped down some ether.

*"Was that your friend?"* - the Warrior carefully accentuated the world ‘friend’ as he said it.

Father nodded without a single word explaining the recent monologue.

*"Are the events still following your plan?"* - asked the Warrior.

Father shrugged in response and tapped on the Warrior's shoulder with the tip of his finger - *"Tell me Bob, when was the last time we played chess together?"*

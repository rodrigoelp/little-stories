Virgil returns to the Temple looking for the staff. He can't find it. He walks back towards the place they first found it and observes some scratches on the ground, clearly the staff had tried to write down a message on the cobbles of the Temple. Virgil smiles thinking it is better for him to not know what Father had tried to say and vanishes on the thin air.

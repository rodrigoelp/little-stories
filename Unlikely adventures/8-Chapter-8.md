# Splashing back

*"(cough cough cough)"* - Sam abruptly woke up, felt like air was rushing through his lungs for the first time in a while. He laid on the soft sandy floor next to the still bodies of Amir and Hannah.



*"... it hurts, doesn't it?"* - said a female voice from above - *"I never liked failing this trial. Never got used to the cold water."*



Sam was disoriented once more, he was back in the candle-lit room with the soft sand and the statue at its centre. Pushing himself up, located using the echos the source of the voice and there she was, sitting on the statue with her legs crossed, a small girl with braided hair and a red bow, her clothes more elaborate than his; the fabric was still linen but it decorated with pink and red feathers intertwined with laces shining in this shaded room. She had an eager look as if she was waiting for an ‘Uh?’

*"I am so confused..."* - finally added Sam, rubbing his eyes with his hands - *"... I was drowning, just now..."*

*"You thought you were drowning... nothing that happens there is real"* - added the girl.

Sam suddenly remembered - *"Amir!"* - looking down, to find the immobile body of his friend - *"Uhm... excuse me..."* - continued Sam after a few moments of silence.

*"I am Yule, if you’re about to ask..."* - interrupted Yule

*"... right.. uhm..."* - Sam tried to make his mind about what to do next.

*"I must say, I am impressed!"* - said Yule giving Sam a few more moments to adjust - *"everyone taking this trial wakes up screaming or crying..."*

*"... right... uhm... my friend..."* - words were unkind to Sam in this moment where his brain struggled to work - *"... is he..."*

*"If he falls in the water, he will wake up... but as soon as you touch the water it hurts so much that you would do anything to avoid drowning"* - explained Yule. She waited a moment, Sam wasn't following - *"Every trial is a challenge of your mind. The statue here is the water guardian and judges you with its gaze. Once you look at its blue eyes your mind is taken to that world until you attain the virtue of the water."*

*"The virtue of the water... Master my inner struggles?"* - said Sam feeling his brain back to its normal working state.

*"Master inner struggles, yes! It means you must find tranquillity when odds are against you. It means you need to be like water, sipping through the cracks of rocks until the rock breaks."* - said Yule encouraging Sam.

*"... right, I see"* - said Sam lost in thoughts - *"I guess I'll have to look at the statue again, no?"*

Yule nodded and extended her arm to stop Sam - *"Before you go back... May I know your name?"*

Sam felt ashamed due to his rudeness - *"Sam."*

Yule smiled and standing up with zero effort said - *"Great talking to you Sam, best of luck next time!"*

Sam looked at the girl standing above him, she had this unique energy to her - *"Wow, so pretty"* - he said unknowingly. Yule laughed and cover her face with her pink wings with red on its edges making her look more striking - *"I meant your wings, so pretty... not that you are not pretty... I mean, you are but... I mean... you brighten the room your thingy... I, uh..."* - his face glowing bright red, Sam didn't know what shoes were, but he wanted to have one in his mouth right at this moment.

*"Thank you!"* - added Yule gliding masterfully to the entrance of the room - *"See you later little moth!"*

*"Hey, wait!"* - said Sam promptly - *"would you help me getting my friends back?"*

Yule stopped a few seconds by the door - *"You need to prove your worth little moth. Otherwise, how are you going to get the approval of the elder of prophecies?"*

*"... the elder of prophecies..."* - repeated Sam, as if repeating the phrase would grant him understanding in a sea of ignorance.

*"The spirit wearing the wolf mask?"* - clarified Yule.

Chills ran down his spine - *"Don't go out! there is a ghost trying to steal our light!"*

Yule smiled again - *"I know... he is ok with me, though. We are friends, you see?"* - she stopped for an instant - *"I've proved myself here and earn my free passage."* - explained.

Sam was utterly impressed with the girl - *"... what if I can't?"*

Her smile flicked like a jolt of a bad memory runs through your brain, slowly erasing the lovely expression into a serious one - *"... You'll lose yourself, your mind and everything you are."* - and changing her expression again to a big smile - *"So, give it all your best! Ok? Good luck!"* - and disappeared from his sight.

Sam turned to face the statue once more - *What does she meant with little moth?* - asked Sam to himself, then stared back at the statue - *Ok judge... Bring it on!* 



A flash of blue light showered Sam and his body dropped heavily on the soft sand next to Amir and Hannah.

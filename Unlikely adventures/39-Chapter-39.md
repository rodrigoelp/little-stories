# Mystic truth

Five coloured streams of steam, formally known as the primordials, drifted across the emptiness of spacetime towards an unknown beyond, leaving behind vague concepts of planets, asteroids, planetoids and stars. Some sort of invisible magical force pulled them towards a foreign dimension where the elders and the residual flames of the star children resided, far away from their home world.

**Fsh! Sh shush ssssh ssh!** - curiously appointed the red mist.

The silvery mist could have rolled its eyes, assuming it had eyes, though it was difficult to tell among all that fuzziness - ***... thsh ksh tsh tsh shsshh.***

*Thshsh sh sh. Ssssshtsh tsh sh chch* - replied the blue one in her surprise.

The yellow mist evaporated slightly with embarrassment due to the observation made by blue - *Fsh thsh tsh chtsh ch?*

**Fffsh, Shhhsh shh ssh!** - joked the red mist to the shocked expression of the spectators.

*Hhhh... Ch, Ththsh. Shush ssh fshts sh sh tsh chi shh vvs sh, tshtsh chtsh?* - reiterated the yellow mist.

*"Tsh ssh shush ch ssh shush fshsh fffsh ssh tsh cch ch"* - replied the little limed coloured one, drifting around the edges of the group. The rest seemed to agree with her astute and valid point.

Of course, knowing the content of said conversation would have been useful indeed, however it was incredibly hard as mystish is a really hard language to master; it requires several years of intense training to allow your immaterial, and quite possibly intangible lips to neatly align the water molecules in the most optimal position to rub each other the right way. You also need to lose your quasi corporeal presence and begin your journey towards the great beyond. It was in fact, a very tricky business to anybody alive.

The journey felt long, though the estimation of the passage of time becomes a guessing game when you have lost most reference of the second component of spacetime, and obviously, a reliable apparatus with a good piece of quartz embedded in it.

The one measurable component of their journey was their ever increasing speed as they continued to accelerate. Most stars became a blur zipping past. The lime coloured mist tried to peek at the passing planets, most of them had shifted towards the deepest blue she has ever seen. She waited a few instants more and the dots had turned into streaks of white.

**Schsh sh ch tsh?** - observed the red mist as they all approached a slit in the fabric of spacetime. The slit didn't have any special characteristic other than, in comparison to the rest of the universe, it was packed with millions of tiny little stars. Now that he took a better look at it, it had a tangible flatness the rest of the universe didn't have.

They all landed on its surface, or whatever that was, weaving the steaming streams into its sticky impermeable matter, almost as if the dimensional fabric infused the content of the vapour with solidity, first defining the contour of their bodies, followed by a good consolidation of their former characters. Almost as if they were emerging from tar.

The first one to stand up was the Turtle. The dimensional fabric tried to mimic the shape of her marine themed wings, but the edges had been adorned with sparkling little stars. She felt rather alive and active, you know, for a Turtle that has been defunct the vast majority of the past few eons.

Behind her a giant blob rolled up, consolidating into the large feline creature the Tiger was. The cosmic fabric weaved into existence a pair of cosmic pants hanging for dear life to the circumference of his waist. His pants, following the theme of the Turtle's wings, were dotted with stars about to ignite. It had infinitesimal glistening lights decorating the majority of his suit, or rather, just the pants as the Tiger had materialised without a shirt to cover his gigantic belly.

*Uh huh... Tiger?* - said the Turtle.

**Yeh, Wuzap?** - he replied stretching his large and muscled extremities capable of dislodging black holes out of the centre of galaxies.

*You may be embarrassed to know, but you are not wearing a top* - said the Turtle with the same level of cheekiness you would expect of those who rarely have the opportunity to be cheeky to others.

The Tiger looked down to his bare, extremely impressive set of pectoral muscles only comparable to those trying to sculpt the manliest man-boobs any set of cosmic eyes have ever set eyes on. The musculature somehow was dwarfed by the definition of his abdomen, assuming round is the primary qualifier used in the definition. It was difficult to him to figure out his attire below his waist line, even in the afterlife he was unable to look at his feet. He gave an apologetic look at the Turtle and smiled scratching his head - **Oh yeh, sorry 'bout dat. I didn't fink 'bout a shirt; dough I must say, I'm not as embarrassed as you might be, you ain't sporting any pants.**

The Turtle looked down, comprehension dawned on her; the celestial breeze over her nether region had a reason to be and it wasn't the afterlife. She immediately sunk into the cosmic fabric. Clearly it was a mistake to be the first one to emerge from whatever that was.

**Don't worry. I saw nofing** - he said reassuringly - **Just your lady parts and it all looked good!**

She sunk even further into the stellar matter. The Turtle was a spirit traditionally coloured with shades of blue and some green, however she felt her face burning as she shone with the entire gamut of reds.

*Don't be mean my dear kitty cat* - said the Spider behind the Tiger, she almost heard him hiss out of sheer surprise.

The Spider wore her usual attire, although it had a few subtle changes. Her wings were covered with what appeared to be a spider web pattern, composed of an assortment of tiny stars giving off the impression the silk of the spider web had been covered with the morning mist. In fact, her wings had enlarged significantly, dragging behind her. The Tiger was somewhat disappointed with her appearance - *Your posture reveals discontent my dear Tiger.*

**Yeh** - he replied monotonically.

*May I ask why?* - asked the Spider with the same expression a mother would assume trying to understand why her child is pouting whilst crossing their arms.

**I was hoping to see your rambunctious posterior up and 'bout ** - he replied causing an instantaneous response from the Spider who joined the Turtle, burying herself deep in the cosmic fabric hiding herself.

*"I would have never expected such words coming from you"* - added the little Bat emerging from the infinite sea of stars. She wore a dress and her bat-like wings had long silver ribbons stretching to infinity, almost as if a stellar nursery had condensed into thin strips of cloth, attaching itself to the Bat's wings.

**I may not have much culture, but I am good dishing out compliments regarding an excellent set of gluteal muscles** - he said lifting his eyebrows with a naughty glance - **You know the saying ‘Tigers always attack from behind’. Well, we are looking at wut we like!**

***At times I wished these pervert comments did not emerge from within our ranks*** - said the Wolf rising from the sea of stars. The cosmic fabric had a hard time figuring out the most appropriate look based on the Wolf's personality. It hung on his back, growing fuzzier by the moment until it settled on a silvery fur jacket, a grey shirt and a pair of pants jagged at the bottom from which asteroids and comets emerged.

The Wolf was pleased with his appearance. However, his pointy ears picked up the bickering happening between his companions. He decided to ignore the discussion, a stranger had stolen his attention.

The stranger sat studying their emergence from afar. He had this inquisitive and mysterious stare, or that was the Wolf's impression as the eyes of the stranger resided hidden from view; the stranger had a very hairy face, mostly covered by a single thick unibrow and a long bushy beard. The beard alone was extremely impressive, so impressive in fact that vikings would sing songs about the old man visiting a far away village and you sort of knew what the old man was doing by the way the beard moved on the streets of their own town. Obviously, that wasn't the case, there were no vikings in their world, or rather in this astrophysical plane.

The old man swung back to stretch his back against the backrest of the inter-dimensional bench. He detailed every movement of the newcomers whilst pulled from his pipe, releasing a puff coalescing into a nebula drifting away. The Wolf couldn't help to notice his attire, there was something jolting memories from long time ago; memories of a distant past when all six primordials walked the realms for the first time.

The Wolf carefully got closer to the old man, analysing his cryptic face hidden by the long beard with the exception of isolated patches, totally covered with wrinkles, and winkles on winkles, and wrinkles on top of the wrinkled wrinkles.

The Wolf had never seen someone so old in his life, or the afterlife, or the after afterlife - ***Who are you?***

The old man gave a meaningful look at the Wolf. If he was smiling, nobody would have known, but the Wolf noticed some of the facial hair shifting orientation and decided it was a smile under all of it.

The Wolf walked closer until his gaze met the almost pure white eyes, intense and bright, staring back - ***Charon?*** 

The name lingered in the air, stopping any argument the girls had against the Tiger's lustful eyes.

The old man pulled his pipe away from his lips, the Wolf expected an insightful comment from him, instead he raised his free hand to scratch his beard and after a few seconds stood up resenting the passage of time, though to be honest what he resented the most was the pain on his lower back - *"How many millennia has it been? Too long in my humble opinion."*

The voice of a long forgotten companion, although somewhat hoarse with the passage of time, brought every sweet memory to the present.

Charon's expression wasn't filled with happiness, it was possible some of it had been washed away with the stupid lumbago messing him up; the other parts of the happiness may have been hiding under his thick long beard and his unibrow framing a large portion of the top of his face - *"Come with me, there is much to be done. Heroes to redeem, stories to fix thanks to you, my dear and partially forgotten idiots..."*

**Come again?** - The Tiger exchanged glances with the Wolf as he wasn't expecting the insult - **Did we messed somefing up?**

*"Oh yes! Plenty! You see, I worked so hard to craft the most appealing tale anybody was capable of singing. An ode about overcoming adversity, finding a motive to push beyond and above any limits, but thanks to you most of it has been thrown out of whack."* - said Charon with a peaceful tone. He stroke his beard straight, untangling any celestial body travelling through the ether - *"You lot chose some random stranger, didn't pay any attention to the hero of my story and even worse, you kicked the bucket before I could reach to you and get the tale back on track."*

The three girls courageously elbowed the Wolf in the middle of his ribs - ***Ow!... Why are you just... Oh! Yes, right. Charon, would you mind to elaborate on the problem?***

Charon smiled with the warmth of a summer sunrise, or so they wanted to believe, it was hard to read his face all covered with his beard and bushy unibrow - *"You are always so formal. You haven't changed one bit Lucius."*

***Lucius?***

*"Yes, wasn't that the name you casted aside? Perhaps eons of isolation in that cave have made you forget your own name"* - reflected Charon tapping his chin - *"What was your other name again? Wolf, was it?"*

The Wolf nodded.

*"Ok then, if that is the case, I would appreciate if you would stop to call me by my first name. I haven't really used that name for a long time."*

The Wolf nodded once more - ***I thought you didn't like us calling you vult-***

*"Ah, I just remembered, Charon would be better if we are going down that path"* - interrupted Charon, his unibrow bent in the shape of someone trying to leave bad memories behind.

**If you don't like Charon or da oder one...** - said the Tiger getting closer to Charon, the old man looked so small in comparison, though you gotta understand scale is quite relative, specially when Charon's beard was a nursery of stars at the beginning of the cosmological genesis - **Maybe you want us to call you like da little ones used to called you: Fader.**

*"Yes, they still do"* - replied placidly Father - *"When they wake up."*

*Could we go back to the previous topic?* - the Spider felt the urge to understand why the Father called them idiots - *What do you mean with ‘we chose a random stranger’?*

*"Always straight to the point, you have always been like that"* - reminisced Father on the old days when he newly arrived to the realms and these familiar faces welcomed him to the group. In those times, he was much younger; younger than any of them - *"The story I composed required the most pure and innocent child I could find. One capable of withstanding the unbearable load of becoming a hero, walk to the gates we closed so many years ago and connect the realm of the living and our realm. I woke him up and awaited for my friend to receive him."*

*‘Him’, huh? Such a classical stereotype to pick a hero to be a boy. You couldn't pick a girl for the role...* - complained the Turtle to the general sentiment of the Spider and the Bat. The whole thing smelled to them to an unfair selection criteria based on gender.

*"It couldn't have been played by anybody else"* - Father replied, feeling all six pairs of female eyes throwing daggers at him - *"You see, this boy fit the most intrinsic requirement to be a hero."*

*"Oh yeah? I really want to hear about this"* - said the Bat folding the sleeves of her robes up in preparation for a few flying punches.

*"You see, the key ingredient of a good hero is to be great at being a fool"* - added Father - *"You need a fool so fool that will run head first towards an oncoming homungous-spiked-covered-octopus whilst they scream ‘In the name of glory!’"*

**Whose dat girl?** - interrupted the Tiger.

*"Who?"* - it has been a while since the last time Father interacted with the Tiger.

**Dat Gloria girl** - replied the confused Tiger - **Was dat da one you chose?**

*... just... Father, just move on with the story* - instructed the Spider. She knew quite well the cost of explaining colloquialisms to the Tiger and even in the afterlife they didn't have that much time.

"Anyway, this child I picked is the greatest of them all. He was perfect!" - The unibrow bent with disapproval - *"Or he was perfect until the other one appeared and threw everything out of whack!"*

The Wolf felt uncomfortable not following who was Father referring to, specially since Sam and Amir share a large portion of the requirement Father was talking about.

**I am sorry Charon, I fought dese kids would needed some encore-age... some assistance to move forward. We had no idea we needed to wait for some oder children** - replied the Tiger fumbling with some stars between his fingers, adverting the gaze of Father.

*"What are you sorry for? Out of the lot you were the only one guiding my champion!"* - clarified Father, this was received with an utter silence from the rest of the spirits.

*WAIT, your hero is Amir?* - enquired the Spider.

*"Is that his name?"* - replied Father.

*I did not see this coming* - said the Turtle holding her head between her hands.

*Now that he mentions it, Amir does fit the role...* - the Spider remembered how he had risked his life to save his friends regardless of his well-being.

*"Who would have thought that kid was so special"* - commented the Bat, mostly to herself. Her comment was welcomed with an ‘Oh yeah, yup’ from the group.

**I did** - said the Tiger showing his big teeth - **I saw wid my two pair of eye balls how he casted magic. His brave-birdy too. Pretty impressive too!**

The Spider wanted to correct him, but it would have derailed the conversation.

*"He naturally can channel magic around him, ideal to break the seal on the Gate of Truth separating this dimension and theirs"* - explained Father - *"That's why it is important he has all the tools to do the job, yet you lot gave four of the blessings to other children."*

*"What about Sam and Hannah?"* - asked the Bat.

*"The girl would have been good motivation for him"* - added Father - *"It was rather convenient she appeared when she did. She could have played the damsel in distress."*

**She did played all my damn cells in stress** - lightly commented the Tiger. He was never that afraid of someone that small.

*‘Damsel in distress’ dear Tiger. As in a girl to be saved.* - explained the Turtle.

**Save wut? Dat girl? She needs no saving! I am sure she would have walked straight to Eden, kick da bloody gate open, make da dragons in running come like puppies and shout at dem dragons to bring her some biscuits wid tea and milk. No need required!** - the Tiger looked for support of his fellow evaluators - **You know I'm rite!**

*"What about Sam?"* - the Bat pressed on to find her answers.

*"That boy is a nuance in my narrative, we ought to get that story straight."* - complained Father drawing out the pipe once more, fumbling with a transient star to use it as a lighter.

The Wolf could taste the lingering discontent Father added when Sam was present in the context - ***If you didn't want Sam as a character of the story, why did you wake him up?***

*"I didn't!"* - said Father getting worked up - *"I didn't wake him up! In fact, I don't even know who he is!"*

**How can you not know? I fought you knew all of dem children** - said the Tiger scratching his belly.

*"I do! Every single child that has ever and will ever walk the realms! However this ‘Sam’, he showed up unannounced and unsolicited. At first I imagined he wasn't that bad of a character, he helped Amir getting out of the island of arrivals, but he has been changing the contents of my plans!"*

**Maybe you didn't use da rite ink** - lightly commented the Tiger.

*"Uh?"* - Father once more felt he had stepped into Tiger's misdirection, or rather, distraction.

**You know, if your fings are rewritten... some pens are better dan oder! Remember when da sailors came ashore and I wrote in dem boat ‘Tiger's cook is great!’ And dey fought I wrote sumfing else, dey tried to erase it but da ink was unerasable...**

Father ignored the Tiger. He could recognise why the Tiger chose Amir out of the bunch. It is the attraction of those with similar qualities.

The Wolf felt annoyed by the indeterminism added to Father's wishes - ***If you didn't send Sam, who did?***

*"That's one of the mysteries we need to figure out, but first we need to find a way to communicate with my friend to get everything back on track."*

*Ok, how do we do that?* - asked the Turtle.

*"That, I do not know either. You know we can't go to the land of the living"* - explained Father - *"and that goes to messages as well."*

**How did you send you friend?** - asked the Tiger, surprising the rest of the group, mostly due to the fact the question was on topic.

*"He... he has special dispensation"* - replied Father - *"He sort of belongs here and nowhere at the same time."*

**Dats radar convenient for plot development** - said the Tiger.

*"Only if I could communicate with him, but I can't"* - added Father - *"You would imagine any of the elders or the primordials could transcend from the great beyond, right?"*

**Maybe dats why it is called great beyond as opposed to da sorta small fing from rite dere** - commented the Tiger.

Father felt somewhat annoyed at his unnecessary commentary.

The Spider began decomposing the information at hand, trying to figure out an alternate route. She was pretty good at those because, if you can't trust a spider from untangling web of ideas, who can? - *Your friend could go back because he is from here and nowhere at the same time, right?*

*"Yes, that's what I said"* - Father replied bringing his pipe back to his lips. He took a deep swing at it, the embers glowed bright and puffed out a large cloud of interstellar dust. The cloud drifted away until it began to collapse into a protostar.

*Right there!* - jumped the Spider - *Do it again!*

Father looked at her puzzled, put the pipe on his lips and puffed another cloud which formed a nebula, tiny dots bursted into rhetorical flames as they collapsed under their own gravity - *"It is an entertaining activity I have found, creating young stars that is."*

*But where does it go?* - enquired the Spider, needing to find the answer to the curiosity itching on her mind.

*"To the cosmos... Joins the universe? I don't know. Darling, you are getting distracted with meaningless events..."* - said Father.

*But how do you do it?* - pressed on the Spider.

*"I don't know, the pipe does it. Why does that matter?"* - Father felt puzzled and annoyed. He didn't remember the Spider having the same personality as the Tiger.

The Wolf could see the Spider noticeable excitement at the object within Father's fingers. Now that he looked at it, it seemed to be more real than reality; and that was a pretty hard thing to achieve given they existed on the after-afterlife. The pipe had a different quality to the cosmic fabric around them - ***Could we see the pipe?***

*"You have seen it plenty of times!"* - replied Father a tad annoyed, he didn't want to give away his only source of placid relaxation - *"It is my bloody staff, look!"*

Father released the pipe in the middle of the air, or rather, the interstellar void. There, it spun slowly until it orientated itself with the bowl upright. Then it creaked and grew its wooden exterior, developing a kink here and there until it took the shape of the Shepherds staff. Its bowl had become the squarish hook, emitting a gentle warmth as it hummed. The Spider got close to it stretching her fingers, however she was unable to touch it. The staff returned promptly to Father's open hand.

*"See? It is the staff I've always used!"* - protested Father.

*How is that staff here?* - asked the Turtle - *I thought magical artefacts could not truly die. It just... changes shape.*

*"Don't be daft... of course it is not dead"* - argued Father - *"I was lucky it found a way to me. I felt incomplete without it after I passed on. I imagine it felt weird without my hand on it as well."*

*So, you are saying the staff came here to find you* - repeated the Spider.

*"That's what I said"* - said Father getting annoyed at the sudden interest on the staff. He knew they have seen it numerous times. He knew some of them felt its crook when he was somewhat annoyed, and he was considering this instant to be a good reminder of the feeling - *"You guys are wasting time on frivolous subjects!"*

***It is not frivolous, think about it, we need a way to reach the realms with a message, right?*** - carefully said the Wolf in an attempt to shed some light on Father's aged reasoning.

*"Yes, but you keep asking about my staff... oh!"* - Father suddenly realised his answer was literally at his fingertips - *"I didn't think about it."*

*"Yes! We can send a message to the realm of the living! Let me sharpen my claw and we can start scribbling on it"* - said the Bat extending her razor sharp claws.

*"Scribbling??? Have you gone mad?"* - yelled Father apprehensively - *"Back off! Back off I said, do not touch it!"*

**But how are we going to send da message?** - asked the Tiger.

*"I'll make it have an interpretative dance! Or I would drag it on the floor and write a note!"* - complained Father.

**Isn't da interpurrative dance da fing people do when dey feel constipated?** - asked the Tiger.

The Wolf wanted to correct him, but in a way, he thought the Tiger might be right.

*"It doesn't matter, I'll find a way!"* - said Father struggling to keep the Bat from grasping the staff.

The Turtle had joined the wrestling, followed by the Spider. It was surprising how agile Father was when it came to protecting his beloved possession.

*Let it go!* - said the Bat still in her child form - *Bloody stubborn man, you should respect your elders!*

**I see where he might have a problem rite dere. He looks older dan us.** - observed the Tiger as Father waved the staff off the reach of the three spirits.

*Tiger, help us get it off Charon!* - pleaded the Spider.

**No ma'am. I fink it is unfair to tackle an ol'man** - said the Tiger, right as the crook of the staff bashed him unconscious on the sea of stars.

*"Oops! Collateral damage!"* - said Father spinning around with the momentum of his staff - *"Look at what you made me do!"*

The momentum was too much for the four spirits balancing over one leg, they all collapsed on a loud splash as the stars of the cosmic sea welcomed them. The Bat quickly climbed on Father just to find his empty hands - *"Where is it?"*

*"Mmmphmph!"* - complained Father pulling his beard off his mouth - *"Get the bloody off me!"*

The Turtle looked at the Wolf, she was somewhat resented for the lack of support - *Fetch the staff, now!*

***Not much point on doing so*** - he replied.

*And why is that?* - asked the Spider.

The Wolf pointed at the staff drifting away from their dimensional pocket - ***I believe it decided to go somewhere else.***

# Rubble

Hannah, Sam, and Amir remained in the middle of the corridor looking at the possible paths ahead.

Hannah detailed her surroundings. With the exception of the sand below their feet, everything else seemed to be made of sandstone, even the gates.

The walls were mostly featureless, if you ignored the grey strata lines branching out every now and then, though, you could spot the sporadic cutout on the wall, resembling a window of sorts.

The maze gave the impression it was designed to accommodate giants, or at least, to prevent its inhabitants from ever escaping. The walls were easily more than six times their height.

Hannah missed her wings, a few flaps and they would have flown straight to wherever they needed to go. How conveniently-inconvenient was this restriction.

Sam felt Hannah's pre-occupied mind trying     to work out possible ways out. He just observed some of the little details of the world around. His brain still churning, trying to understand the odd sensation when they first arrived - *Why was everything so... sandy?*

Amir walked up and down the corridor, he had found a few blocks carved out of the wall, sort of like a stair, as the elevated platform curved out of sight into a foreign passage.

*"Should we split? Some go to the right and some go to the left?"* - asked Hannah.

*"That is, N.O.P.E - Nope!"* - stated Amir firmly.

*"Why not?"* - said Hannah inquisitively.

*"Because it feels like, if we split, we will be easy target to someone lurking with a machete wearing a creepy mask or something"* - explained Amir.

*"What's a machete?"* - asked Sam, puzzled by the entire statement.

*"It is a... well... Whatever. The point is, a monster could come out and do bad things to us"* - explained Amir, wondering himself about the machete - *"We came together, we die together."*

*"Isn't the phrase: We came together, we stick together?"* - corrected Sam as he turned to face Hannah's back as she walked away, eastward from the gate. Both Amir and Sam followed her.

The path bent and turned slightly a few times, coming to an abrupt interruption as a gap removed a large part of the corridor, leaving three floating boulders, suspended in midair by invisible forces. The boulders rotated freely, defiant of gravity. The tiny leverage of the air passing through made the boulders softly spin.

*"That does not seem safe"* - remarked Hannah looking apprehensively at the nothingness below the boulder - *"I think this is a dead end. Let's go back."* - she continued as she marched west followed by Amir.

Sam remained behind, silent and entranced by the dance of the boulders, disconnected from reality just suspended by magical forces. 

Sam heard the faint action of his friends' steps and knew he had to get going. As his eyes wandered away of the boulders, his gaze drifted up towards the black featureless and monotonous sky, he noticed up above him at the edge of the walls, little spider decorations discreetly carved at random locations. The tiny spiders seem to be weaving the strata lines trapped in the sandstone, yet they all had something in common. They all faced eastward, past the gap and beyond into the depths of the interrupted corridor. He opened his mouth to report his finding but, Hannah and Amir had disappeared looking for a safe passage on the other end of the corridor. He followed.

A few turns and twists away from Sam, Amir's finger travelled the groove of the little grey lines captured in the stratified sandstone. His little game of chasing the lines came to an end when he ran into Hannah's back.

*"Oouph!"* - Amir had landed on his rear as Hannah stared up, totally immovable - *"I'm sorry."*

*"Look there! There is another memorial stone up there"* - she pointed to a white grave-stony-looking stone above. The stone rested on one of the cutouts, though it was high enough it was out of their reach.

*"I bet there is a clue written on it."* - she commented curiously as she tried to figure out a way up.

*"What makes you think that?"* - ask Amir.

*"It looks just like the one outside"* - she said as she wedged her feet on a crevice in the wall and shoved her fingers in some cracks in an attempt to climb up.

*"Oh yeah, now that you mention it, it does look like that stone outside"* - repeated Amir, leaving Hannah alone as she attempted to reach the top.

Hannah's feet slipped, causing a chain reaction in which her weight pulled her stretched arm and fingers. The fingers screamed in pain, letting her go, dropping her on the soft-ish ground below. An extended hand invited her to stand again - *"Thanks Sam"* - she added grabbing the hand.

*"No worries, what's there?"* - replied Sam.

*"The stone above it, I think it may have a clue or can tell us what to do."* - she stated dusting off her clothes; not that it needed it as their clothes didn't seem to get dirty. 

*"Maybe you can stand on my shoulders. Get on me and I get on Amir and then you try to reach up?"* - Sam explained the convoluted impractical idea. Hannah gave him a look saying *‘never gonna happen’*

*"Ah, here is says ‘Thou shalt plead **mansit** before venture ahead’"* - said Amir happily reading the stone.

Sam and Hannah stood quiet for an instant, turning around looking for Amir. They couldn't find him. Hannah looked up and saw Amir crouching beside the stone.

*"How?"* - she asked, puzzled at Amir's sight next to the stone.

*"How what?"* - queried Amir needing a little more context to understand the previous question.

*"How did you get there?"* - she clarified.

*"Oh, that was easy! There is a rock thingy here, you jumped there, pushing yourself there to the other thingy, then here, stretched your arm up to here and then..."* - he explained naturally, just stopping and he failed to recalled the last three steps he made to get up there.

Hannah leaned closer to Sam and whispered - *"Is he half goat?"*

Sam limited himself to use his preferred way of explaining things. He shrugged.

*"What's that of the plead adventure?"* - asked Sam trying to remember the words.

*"Thou shalt plead ‘**mansit**’ before venture ahead"* - read Amir once more.

*"Mansit?"* - said Sam wondering about the odd word - *"What's mansit?"*

*"It means ‘stay still’ in old tongue"* - replied Hannah - *"How can we stay still if we need to continue on?"*

A thud bounced off the walls. Sam and Hannah ran around the elevated gravestone to find Amir flat out spread on the floor.

Amir lifted his head enough to let a *"OuhmmMmm"* out as a formal complaint with a mouth filled with sand.

*"Are you alright?"* - asked Hannah as she lifted him up with care.

*"Yeah, I just tried to come down and the rock spun as I stepped on it."* - explained Amir rubbing his nose and blowing some sand out of his nostrils.

Hannah looked behind them, a gravity defying rock floated as a stepping stone to reach the platform.

*"You can step on these?"* - she asked rhetorically.

*"Well... not for long. This sand feels a lot less soft when you fall head first..."* - continued Amir complaining.

She observed the floating rock for an instant, her brain connected the dots - *"Maybe we can ask the rocks to stop spinning or moving in the air."*

*"Pfff, you want to ask it what? A rock is a rock!"* - added Amir - *"You can't talk to a **silly** rock like I would to y-ouch!"*

Amir's dialogue was interrupted by a sizeable pebble which landed neatly on his head. The pebble came down with abnormal speed as if it was thrown by someone or something. Hannah observed the immobile material of the wall, curiosity filled her mind.

*"Are you sure they can't hear you?"* - asked Hannah inquisitively without diverting her eyes from the wall.

*"Are you daft?"* - replied Amir - *"of course brainless things can't hear u-ouch!"*

The fragile, probably senile, sandstone wall could not help itself from losing one or two pebbles on one imprudent child. It was a biological... erm, mineralogical malfunction that only comes with age of standing on the same spot for aeons.

Hannah's face lit with a big wide smile - *"I gotta try this!"* - she said as she turned to face the floating rock, took a deep breath and said peacefully - *"Stay still!"*

Nothing happened.

*"See? I told you!"* - reproachably said Amir - *"These are not living things! Are just stupi-ouch-Ouch-OUCH!"*

Sam saw Amir rubbing his head, on which five red spots could be clearly seen and five pebbles around Amir confirmed the source of the colouration. He then understood what Hannah was trying to achieve and stepped away from Amir as he feared the accidental pebble dislodgement might not be accidental after all.

*"Perhaps there is a nicer way to say it?"* - added Sam.

*"YES!"* - said Hannah excitedly. Her voice echoed through the corridor.

*"I forgot about it Sam"* - she added and facing the stone once more she said - *"Please, could you stand still?"*

The spinning rock softly came to a halt. The children observed the rock a few moments more.

*"Holy crab! It worked!"* - said an astonished Amir - *"How did it work? These are just mindless roc-OUCH!"*

*"Amir, you are as dense as a ro..."* - Sam stopped himself from completing the sentence. A pebble stared back at him in defiance - *"As dense as... you are very dense Amir."*

Out of fear of losing their companion due to multiple blunt concussions, Hannah and Sam decided it was best to explain to Amir it is wise to not speak ill of their surroundings.

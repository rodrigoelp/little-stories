# Eyes shut

A starless black sky leered back at Sam, the funny sensation of not feeling anything was back.

His hands moved inquisitively on the snow, there was resistance but the coldness of it was not there.

Now Sam stopped to think about the concept of snow - *how did he know what snow was? All he ever saw was sand and the little patch of grass at hub* - so many questions were rushing through Sam's mind at that particular moment.

*"AAAAAAAARRGGGGGGG, my leg!!!!!!"* - the distant scream snapped Sam back into this reality and told him Amir had changed his location from the last time he saw him.

*"Are you alright?"* - said Hannah with anguish.

*"Seriously what is in this water? My leg went numb again! I can't walk, it hurts!"* - replied Amir, covering subtly fear sipping though the tone.



Sam stood up calmly, took a deep breath and using the full extent of his lungs called his friends - *"OI AMIR! I AM COMING NOW!"*



A few moments of stillness gave the impression that Amir and Hannah drowned due to the shock - *"SAM?????"* - broke Amir the silence of the frigid environment.

Sam analysed this little detailed more meaningfully, even environmental sounds are completely absent here. The normal splish-splash of the water swaying in and out of the shore wasn't there.

*"SAM? ARE YOU OK SAM? PLEASE, TELL ME YOU ARE OK!?"* - said Amir breaking the stillness of the odd day with black skies, his voice almost showing signs of fragility as well.

Sam adjusted his voice, he roughly knew how loud he needed to be now - *"I am fine Amir, trying to figure out how to get to you"* - he added.

*"... I thought you... died... I saw you... sinking in the... water..."* - said Amir between sobs, slowly calming down.

*"It is ok, I am here now"* - added Sam, his mind locked calculating and timing the movement of the water - *A big wave comes in every 10 seconds, the wave lasts about 15 seconds. The islets... this looks like an archipelago with the islets connected underwater by thin sheets of ice* - continued observing Sam - *If I run just before the tide goes down I might get 1 or 2 seconds before the water covers the ice-sheet again and I' ll be safe.*

Sam's brain seemed to be working at maximum capacity, he had visualised a pathway to reach 3 or 4 islets from where he was standing just need to wait for the wave to start to come down, he analysed - *5... 4... 3... 2...* - and threw himself down a slide towards the next hill. The snow allowed him to slide rather easily from where he was standing to the ice-sheet, from there he started to ice-skate naturally.

He could see in the corner of his eye the water starting to reverse, rushing back. He was already at the base of what it looked now a hill, climbed up, the water separated the now islets.

*"Amir, how are you now?*" - said Sam, still counting the next cycle in which he would run to the next islet.

*"All right, I guess..."* - said Amir calmly - *"I am starting to dig the look of my foot all blue."*

*"Yuck! please put it down"* - said Hannah. Sam imagined Amir showcasing with pride his 'battle scar' to Hannah. Certainly, her expression would be amusing.

*... 3... 2...* - Sam started running once more fixated on a hill about 20 metres, his feet moving as if he had skates, pushing him forward as he continued to get closer - *this would be rather fun... under other circumstances* - he though, reaching the base of the hill and pulling himself up crawling on his arms and legs.



*"How are we?"* - queried Sam trying to orient himself.

*"Good... my foot is still blue... I wonder if it froze..."* - said Amir.

*"uhm, could we please stop the commentary?"* - said Hannah.

*"... but you are not even looking at it!"* - argued Amir.

*"I don't want to look at it and I don't want to hear about it"* - continued Hannah - *"... no.. but.. wha... what are you doing?"*

*"I want you to touch it!"* - said Amir with the voice that clearly showed he was doing it to annoy her - *"Just tell me if I am going to lose the leg!"*



Sam was having trouble concentrating on counting and he missed one of the cycles - *"Could you both remain quiet? Please..."* - Sam focused again, the wave continued on its periodic dance, going down, slowing it to a halt and returning on the ice swallowing it whole. At its peak, Sam counted back to 2 and jumped skating to the 3rd hill - *I am still on the right track a few more and I might be able to see them... 4... 3... 2...* - and other jump and Sam continued skating at the same pace, the 4th hill seemed to be further away. He moved his legs faster to catch up, the water started to rush back over the ice, he was a fair distance from getting over the crest but he needed just one extra second or the water was going to reach him.

A gush of water rushed in front of him, he skipped over, a larger gush covered a large portion of his path, he deviated a little to avoid most of it, dry land was coming if only he could jump and he took the dive, momentarily flying over some of the water landing on the hill - *wesh! I made in the nick of ti...* - thought Sam interrupted by the feeling of carving knives sculpting his right leg.

*"AAARRRGGGGHH!!"* - he yelled to allow the pain to escape his body as he dragged himself higher. Even though his leg wasn't in the water any more, he continued to feel the cold water cutting through the tissue, he bit his hand to contain some of the pain and here, Sam learnt a valuable lesson for the future; the mental image of biting your own hand to tolerate some other pain only leaves you to two sources of pain - *this is not real, this is not real, this is not real* - repeated mentally. Somehow clenching his eyes made the pain go away.



*"... I know you said we should stay quiet but... you just screamed. Have you drown?"* - said Amir.

*"What kind of question is that?"* - replied Hannah scolding Amir - *"When people drown they aren't scream Aaargh!"*

*"Ah, I see..."* - said Amir with signs of enlightenment - *"they would usually go like: ’gloob gloob... glup’, right?"*

*"I am fine"* - lied Sam - *"... it looks easier than what it is and I... slipped and twisted my ankle."*



The murmur Amir had with Hannah discussing their future death told Sam his friends were close - *"Where are you now?"*

*"On a bigger chunk of ice"* - said Hannah in a sort of lament - *"We tried reaching one of the hills but Amir slipped again and fell in the water for an instant."*

*Their voices are so close* - thought Sam - *I gotta see where they are at*.



Sam leaned forward and put weight on his leg, shooting pain blinded him for a second then he could see an iceberg spinning with the two children on it. Hannah seemed to be scouting at the same time and she had spotted good news - *"Sam! Here!"*

*Despite the horrible awful pain and the blue colouration, my leg feels all right* - though Sam in an attempt to persuade himself to press forward, he gave tentative few steps as his brain adjusted to ignore the pain - *it is not real, it's not real* - continued Sam, managing to subside the pain. His mind was in a state of flux, similar to the tide - *I can do this* - continued Sam as someone reading a book of positive reinforcement, his mind getting sharper and less distracted about the immediate situation.



His legs started to move without him thinking about it and leapt forward jumping on pieces of ice floating in the current, a few of the chunks splashed down dipping his feet slightly in the water, he ignored the ache coming from his legs as he continued moving through the frozen world.

*"How is he doing that?"* - rhetorically asked Amir mesmerised by friend prowess - *"Doesn't that hurt?"*

*"He is drenched"* - said Hannah utterly impressed - *"but he keeps running and jumping over the ice"*

Sam wasn't listening to the commentary as his utmost attention was centred on keeping himself from falling on the deep water.

Two more icebergs were left spinning in the water as he ran over them, another hill left behind with skid marks and finally one big jump landing right next to Amir who was looking at him as if Sam suddenly had become a deity. Sam plummeted on the spot.

*"I'm..."* - started taking a deep breath - *"...fine"* - another gulp of air filled his lungs - *"Let's continue... in a moment..."*

*"Sam... look at you! You’re a complete mess! Your arms are blue! Your legs are blue!"* - observed Hannah.

*"And there are other things blue here too"* - stated Amir looking at Sam's body - *"Hey! I am standing and my leg isn't killing me!"*

*"... it's all... in our heads..."* - fought Sam with his breathing - *"the pain is... not real..."*

In between breathing, Sam could see a blueish light shining above one of the hills, the possibility surfaced in his thought the end of the trial is near.

Amir turned to follow Sam's gaze that was fixated on a point above a hill.

*"Buddy, are you all right?"* - said Amir.

*"I think we need to go to the blue light"* - continued Sam mind absently from the pair of eyes fixated on him.

*"What light?"* - said Hannah - *"the only blue I see here is the water... and your extremities... everything else is black or white!"*

Sam reflected for a moment - *"You can't see the light there? just above the hill?"*

Amir stared at it trying to find the elusive source in Sam's imagination - *"Nope"*



Sam closed his eyes and took one big breath. 

Exhaling the air felt quite nice, he had grown used to the lack of sensation of the snow between his fingers and the multiple sources of pain had quiet down considerably from a few moments before - *right... maybe this is part of the challenge* - he thought analytically whilst crossing his legs under his body and pushing himself straight up.

Sam opened his eyes to analyse the path between them and the blue light above the hill, which had a higher elevation than the rest he has seen so far, it wasn't surrounded by icebergs they could use to close the gap and reach it. There wasn't any ground or bridge connecting the hill with any other platform.



*"What now chief?"* - asked Amir.

*"I don't know..."* - said Sam looking at the clear water as the iceberg they were standing on drifted aimlessly around a shallow area, it's bottom touching gently the ice-sheet anchored below.

*"Well... at least the waves are gone."* - said Hannah optimistically.

The trio remained in silence spinning softly. Sam racked his brain trying to find an answer.

Amir laid down and stared at the black sky - *"... it is seriously impressive, uh?"*

Hannah looked at Amir - *"What is?"*

*"The sky... it is so black... no stars, no features. Just black!"* - continued Amir.

*"... and that is amusing because?"* - tried to understand Hannah.

*"... I don't know... I just think it is interesting!"* - replied Amir - *"If you just stare at it, you don't know if your eyes are open or closed... almost like a dream!"*



*Almost like a dream* - thought Sam - *a featureless sky is like having your eyes closed*. 

The idea bounced in Sam's head, the gears were moving, he could almost reach the idea and on a few seconds Sam would introduce a word never heard on this world before.

*"Eureka!"* - yelled Sam.

*"Who?"* - replied Hannah.

*"I've found it!"* - translated Sam.

*"You found eureka?"* - questioned Amir completely puzzled.

*"No, no... eureka means I've found it!"* - explained Sam - *"I felt like it was a good thing to say just before doing this!"*

Sam closed his eyes - *nothing but a dream* - and stepped from the edge of the iceberg onto the submerged ice-sheet. Amir contained a yelp and Hannah covered her mouth for an instant.

*"... How? How are you not sinking or screaming in pain?"* - Amir dared to ask.

*"Out of sight, out of mind!"* - said Sam with his eyes closed - *"None of this is real!"* - Sam had a euphoric look on his face -*"Tranquillity and peace of mind! Ha ha ha, of course!"*

Hannah and Amir looked apprehensively at Sam.

*He lost his mind* - thought Amir holding Hannah tight - *"Buddy... are you ok?"*

*"Yes! Ha ha ha, you gotta try this Amir!"* - said Sam with a big grin on his face, eyes still shut tight.

*"I... I don't think so buddy."* - replied Amir.

Hannah shook Amir's grip off - *"Alright, what do I need to do? Anything would be better than continue to be stuck on this chunk of ice."*

*"Close your eyes, take a deep breath and step towards my voice!"* - explained Sam.

*"And it won't hurt?"* - said doubtfully Hannah.

*"Nope! I promise!"* - said Sam raising his pinky finger far enough she could cross it with her pinky, closed her eyes and stepped forward.

There was no splash, just ripples of the water moving away from Hannah's body.

*"Did I do it? I don't feel anything, just the ground"* - checked Hannah.

*"Are you going to start laughing maniacally as well?"* - teased Amir.

*"About what?"* - queried Hannah.

*"Well.. you are in the water with Sam"* - described Amir.

A grin started to form on Hannah's face - *"For real?"*

*"Oh dear... you two lost it"* - said Amir.

*"You don't understand! We feel nothing! just the ground Amir... is like the water is not there!"* - explained Sam.

*"Crickey! really? We just needed to close our eyes and that's it?"* - said Amir in a somewhat disappointed tone - *"Let me get in and..."*

*"NO!"* - said Sam immediately .

Amir stopped frightened  - *"What now? What is it? Is there a monster? What?"*

*"Sorry Amir, but... we can't see, you see? We need you to see where we are going as we cannot see."* - explained Sam.

*"Poorly explained but I understand... you want me to guide you to the islet you said it had a light?"* - simplified Amir.

*"Correct!"* - replied Sam, the smile could have been since kilometres around.

Sam walked with holding hands with Hannah as instructed by Amir. They walked slowly towards the hill, their toes guide them on any debris covering the ground, for the most parts it was as flat as a disc. Sam satisfied attitude exploded when his toes told him they had reached high enough from the flat ground - *"Are we out of it? Out of the water?"* - reviewed Sam.

*"I... I think so. You are far away..."* - replied Amir - *"Is it my turn?"*

Sam slowly opened his eyes, their feet were a fair distance off the water - *"Oh yes buddy, come here!"*

It wasn't long until the trio had regrouped and looked towards the top of the hill. Their hearts filled with happiness stopping right in front of the blue flame.

*"You still can't see it?"* - checked Sam.

*"Your imaginary light? No... but hey! There is a stone with drawings on the floor"* - replied Amir, all three looked down.




```
Open your heart to the spirit of the water for you have gained the strength to beat adversity.
```



*"What does it mean?"* - asked Hannah

*"... perhaps, it means..."* - said Sam grabbing the blue flame with his hands, it resembled the little orb Virgil had given them before. 

Sam drove carefully the flame closer to his chest, its boundaries faded away as it approached his own, absorbing the blue flame. His body burst with light.

*"Sam? What did you do? You're glowing!"* - said Amir, covering his eyes as Sam's glow increased in intensity.

An imaginary audience saw the scene fading to white.

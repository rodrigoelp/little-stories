# Prologue

Hello there!

Welcome to this strange and wacky story, so strange in fact, that I am not quite certain where to start...

Maybe I could initiate it with a humble *'A long time ago and a place far far away...'*, nah that is not it... 

Perhaps a *'Only ever met one elder I wouldn't wanna fight'*. I am not divine enough to quote it.

How about *'The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air'*, this is too formal 

*'When I was young I meant the most beautiful light...'* uhms, the truth is I am not that kind of narrator, I don't want to start this story with clich√©s.

The story I am about to tell is about sacrifice, friendship, admiration and a tad of perspiration. It is a story about how gorgeous the sky we sit under can be; a sky filled with billion-billion stars.

A story that makes us remember to *"Be humble, for you are made of dirt. Be noble, for you are made of stars"* - Serbian proverb.

... keep on shining little stars.

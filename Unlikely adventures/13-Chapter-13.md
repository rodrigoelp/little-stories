# Earthbound

The trio of children walked around a stone statue sitting on a stack of dark grey rocks. Candles lit the room similarly to the trial of water, the arrangement of the candles was somewhat different. At the trial of water, the statue was surrounded by the candles, in here most of the candles were located at each side of the statue, casting two large shadows giving the appearance the statue was moving with the shadows.



The statue was made of a similar material as the previous statue, a porous granite rock, mostly grey and white but it had a hint of rose pink, giving off the impression the statue was once a living creature that solidified over eons. Its face was covered by a mask which, to the children, it looked like a giant spider eating its user's face away.



*"It looks ghastly"* - described helpfully Amir - *"having that thing on its face wouldn't have been nice. If you look up close, its legs have hairs on them!"*



*"This trial's guardian seems to be a girl"* - observed Sam, detailing the delicate traits present on the figure in front of him.



*"Maybe that spider is not part of the spirit and it is just waiting to jump on us"* - continued Amir describing the horrid sight. 



*"Last time we had to look at its face"* - discussed Sam with the rest of the children - *"If you looked to its eyes it would flash you with blue light and you woke up in that world."*

*"Which eye do we need to look at? it was 8!"* - argued Amir in an attempt to pick signs of life revealing the mask was indeed a creature lurking for its next victim.



*"The sand is so soft here"* - commented Hannah and they continued to circle the spirit's statue. She had the vague recollection of the sensation of the mound of sand which was their bed.



*"I hate to make you repeat it but, tell us how it happened the last time?"* - she queried.



Sam looked down in an attempt to recover as many details of the last encounter with the water spirit - *"I remember the soft sand in there, I stood on top of it and looked at the statue, I wanted to find you and I was scared you were dead. Then the statue flashed me and felt like my guts were pulled inside out for a second because all the feeling was gone. The next time I opened my eyes, I was in that world."*



*"When Amir and I walked in that room, we saw the candles. I told Amir not to touch anything, then the bright light woke us up in there"* - she analysed.



*"Amir? What are you doing?"* - said Sam looking at Amir staring intensely at the statue.

*"You said we had to look at it. I am looking at it!"* - he stated feeling his eyes drying up as he continued the one-sided staring competition with the statue.



Nothing happened for a few minutes.



*"Perhaps we should say some magical words"* - resumed Amir his conversation - *"Hokus pokus!"*

*"I don't think it'll work"* - said Hannah.

*"Abracadabra!"* - continued Amir. Nothing happened.

*"Boom shaka laka!"* - he tried again.

Still nothing.

*"I'll take the rubbish out!"* - he said trying out an old trick.

*"How is ‘I'll take the rubbish out’ a magic word..."* - said Sam questioning Amir's methods, comprehension dawned on him - *"Oh wait, never mind."*

*"Amir, please stop this. You are giving me a headache"* - said Hannah rubbing her eyes gently. He went quiet instantly.



The children went around the statue one more time, trying to understand how to begin the challenge ahead.



*"Wait, what's that?"* - said Hannah behind the statue, crouching looking the stone at its base.

*"It has some writing on it"* - she added - *"It is too dark to see what it says!"*

Sam had come to help her, blocking as a result the little light reaching Hannah - *"Could you please move away? You are making it worst."*



*"I'm just trying to help"* - said Sam apologetically, walking about to face the statue.

*"I'm sorry Sam, I wasn't trying to be rude but..."* - she said standing to the side of the statue, leaving the phrase incomplete as most people tend to do excusing a horrible trait of themselves. She got fixated on Sam's face filled with regret and walked discouraged towards Sam as she tried to think on ways to read the text.



*"`Ipsa scientia potestas est.`"* - said Amir's voice.

*"What?"* - said Hannah confused.

*"Ipsa scientia potestas est... that's what it says here"* - restated Amir's voice from behind the statue.

Sam and Hannah both looked puzzled at the statue - *"How can you read it?"*

Amir stood up. A lit candle in his hand - *"You said it was too dark, I grabbed one of these and came to read it. Do you know what it means?"*

Hannah looked at Amir with a different light, different from the lighted candle in his hand, either way - *"... let me think what you just said."* - she added.

*"‘scientia’ is the old way of saying knowledge, I think."* - she said reflexively.



Sam and Amir watched her with admiration.

*"Do you really understand what it says here?"* - said Amir filled with some wonder, as he walked closer to Sam and Hannah, joining them on the mound of soft sand.

*"Not a whole lot"* - she replied deep in thoughts deconstructing the phrase - *"...‘Ipsa scientia potestas est’... something knowledge is something... I think ‘ipsa’ means ‘of it’... the knowledge of it is potestas?"*



Amir chuckled drawing a smile showed briefly on his face. 

*"It almost sounds like: ‘Knowledge on itself is power’... ow, woh, what is happening?"* - said Amir frightfully as a rumbling sound filled the room and the soft sand beneath their feet vibrated.

*"Amir, you did it! The statue's eyes are lit!"* - said Hannah excitedly watching eight little yellow flames appear on the spirit's mask.

The trio embraced awaiting eagerly the flash of light sending them to a strange land. The rumble continued filling up the small room as it got more intense. They could feel it on the sand as the vibration went from the granules to their bones, stopping at their knees. Some candles gave out on their vertical orientation and decided to lay down.



Sam was worried - *Why haven't we been transported to the other world? Is this challenge so different?*

Hannah looked at the ceiling of the room with a concern looked - *"I hope we haven't failed the trial already and the roof comes down on us"*

*"Ah great, the one time I am not deadweight turned out in me killing all of us!"* - said Amir disappointed in himself.



The rumbling sound stopped as suddenly as it had started, the statue remained immobile with its yellow glowing eyes staring at them. The trio recovered their standing and waited in the silence for a minute.



*"I think we are sav-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!!"* - tried to comment Amir as the mound of sand sucked them down with it as the sand disappeared in a sinkhole, dropping the trio to the void beyond.

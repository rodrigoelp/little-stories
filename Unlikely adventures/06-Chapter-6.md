# Stepping into the darkness

The clouds gentle rolled, softly sprayed a tender mist on Amir's face, it was refreshing and helped him get distracted from the current argument with Sam - *"... I've no idea where he is now. Just sit here..."* - he said carelessly.

*"Oi Virgil! Where are you?"* - Sam continued running and flapping side to side with apprehension - *"... Amir, stop lazy around and help me find him... Now!"*

*"Me? why should I? I remember correctly a certain Sam racing me and stopping <sub>without warning, if I may add</sub> to inspect a teal coloured butterfly..."* - stated Amir, lethargy filled every single word - *"Isn't he the one training us? shouldn't he be looking for us?"*

*"I have"* - said a voice behind the curtain of clouds hiding a mountain beyond its fluffy appearance.

Chills ran down Amir's neck -*"What do you mean you have?"* - said Amir in a tone demanding clarification - *"... Sam, how did you move your voice behind the clouds?"*

Sam peered through the clouds - *"Virgil?"* - a ghostly shape deformed the path of the drops suspended in the air, bouncing between little packets of stardust.

*"I am starting to understand Father saying some children can make you age a century or two before breakfast"* - monotonically said Virgil to no one in specific - *"You two have the attention span of fruit flies..."*

*"Uh? What are fruit flies?"* - replied curiously Sam

*"Animals with very short attention span"* - continued Virgil

*"How short?... ooh! Black and lime butterfly!"* - exemplified Sam to Virgil's lack of amusement.

Virgil turns around to face Amir, who was pleasantly embracing a dream in which he won a bet against Sam beating him 20 times in a row and Sam had to be called Mr Smelly Hole. Virgil could pierce through the undeveloped mind of the children easily, he felt cheeky long enough to bump a clump of suspended drops, rushed towards the ground in free fall thanks to the spacetime curvature.

*"Cough, cough, cough... w... what happened?"* - said Amir clearing his throat of water.

*"Maybe your otherworldly fantasy made you drool in abundance overflowing your capacity to swallow"* - snarkily commented Virgil. He felt odd as his immaterial muscles flexed the contours of his mouth into a concave shape, also known as a smile - *"fortunately, you two drifted to the entrance of the cave..."* and as on queue, the clouds broke apart to reveal a deep cave running deep into the mountain.

Understanding dawned on the children and made them appreciate the entrance to the cave of prophecies.

*"Wow!"* - appointed Sam.

*"Amazing!"* - remarked Amir

*"Outstanding!"* - stated a female voice near the trio.

*"Wow, Virgil. was that you inner girl?"* - said Amir without turning to the source of the voice.

*"No, I think it was the actual little girl standing next to you..."* - clarified Virgil simply.

*"Who's Virgil?"* - asked a little girl wearing the same garments both kids were wearing with one clear difference, she had decorated the edges of her shirt with pink petals, her white hair was short and neatly arranged

*"Who... are you?"* - asked Sam, approaching inquisitively to the girl, detailing her garments as if she was hiding something they have never seen before.

*"My name is Hannah, yours?"* - replied Hannah peacefully before Sam could form another question.

*"A... Am... I'm..."* - startled Sam, in an attempt to confront someone with such lovely features.

*"Amir here! Hi! I am Amir and this is my friend Sam..."* - promptly intervened Amir in an attempt to get the attention of the girl - *"we are adventurers of these lands, looking for secrets no one has ever seen before..."*

*Pfff* - loudly argued Virgil, conveying the statement Amir had just made could not even be considered a hyperbole but rather an intentional misinterpretation of reality - *"you are lucky she can't see me or hear me"* - but the statement was ignored by Amir.

*"What do you mean she can't see you?"* - asked Sam confused with the current state of events.

*"Who are you talking to? ... Why are you looking at a cloud?"* - queried Hannah once more - *"are you guys some sort of freaks?"*

*"... My friend here, you know... his flame is in the right place but,"* - Amir lowered his voice so just Hannah could hear him - *"... when it comes to his head, things aren't working right"*

*"Why are you saying he is either silly, crazy or both?"* - ask Virgil to Amir loud enough that Sam could not ignore it - *"Are you trying to look good in front of this girl?"*

*"Hey! What are you saying, Amir? You are mean!"* - said Sam reproachfully - *"Do you like this girl?"*

Amir turned to face Sam - *"Duuuuude, not cool!"* - his face was turning redder by the second. He gulped air, in an attempt to recover some dignity, and turned around to face Hannah smiling a little - *"Just... ignore my friends... friend!... One friend, not many... because there is nobody else here, right?"*

Virgil rolled his eyes, Sam turned to face Virgil and Amir, he was speechless, softly leaned towards Virgil and asked - *"Is it for real she can't see you?"* - receiving a quick nod from Virgil

*"Just the two of you should be able to see me, I'm afraid..."* - explained Virgil - *"and hear me too... Not that you listen much when I am about to explain thi.."*

*"Where's Amir?"* - queried Sam, he turned around just enough to notice Amir's shape disappear behind the curtain of darkness surrounding the cave's entrance - *"Amir! Come back!"*

*"(sigh)... it is a tad late for that, Sam."* - said Virgil with a hint of concern - *"I might need to ask you to go with him and face the trials now. I wished I had more time to prepare you for it but you gotta do what you gotta do; I'll wait at the exit of the cave..."*

Sam mind absently moved his legs taking a few steps and stopped - *"... wait! aren't you coming?"*

*"No"* - said Virgil dryly. Sam's piercing eyes drilled for answers without asking - *"... I am not allowed in such a sacred space... now go, before that fool gets in trouble"* - added Virgil

Sam nodded and rushed in to look for his friend. Virgil observed how the shadows gradually engulfed his shape as he ventured deeper into the cave - *"... now, I just need to wait for my little fools to overcome the difficulties ahead."* - turning away from the entrance and walking away to increase the dramatical delivery of the moment, he slowed down and stopped a few steps away from where he was standing, stretched his hand and grabbed a piece of his pale grey linen garments, tearing a piece off and releasing it into the air.

The piece of cloth floated a second or two trying to gain consciousness, the wobble turned into a soft sway awaiting for orders - *"I am curious what would happen if you go in..."*

The piece of cloth seemed to have found a wind current dragging it in the direction of the cave, swaying its way mid-air getting closer to the entrance, as it went past the umbral the linen started to change its structure, the threads of linen became thin and silky, the pale grey grew darker until it became pitch black - *"I guess there is too much magic inside... I'll wait on the other side then..."* - said Virgil to a hypothetical audience that wasn't around - *"let's go back, I want to feel the grass under my feet..."* - the patch of black silk rushed back to its owner, turning back into pale grey linen and attaching to its original place, Virgil disappeared.

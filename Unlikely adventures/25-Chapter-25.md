# Spectral memories

Sam's mind revolted against his good judgement whilst he stepped out of the room in which the earth trial took place. His hands rested against the sharp edge the crack cut in the rock, crack that acted as a gate for the room.

*Why am I so upset about these two being so lovey-dovey?* - thought Sam.

*I mean, it must be the cave that is playing with me, right?* - he continued whilst extending his arm to reach a few roots protruding from the walls, in an attempt to gain some balance as he walked towards the centre of the chamber.

To Sam, the chamber had a different air. The still water around the monolith with the signs of the trials wasn't still anymore, there was some life to it as ripples oscillated on its surface.

Sam knew what to expect next as the events unfolded in his imagination: he was going to stand on that soft, almost powdery, sand in the middle of the little island of the pond, visible by the single streak of light filtering down from the ceiling. He would stand close to the monolith and the spectral figure wearing the wolf mask would appear behind him, projecting that thunderous husky commanding voice that got in his nerves.

Sam turned around expecting the companionship of his friends but remembered they might be sucking each others faces and the foul mood appeared in his heart - *Argh! Better to face the wolf than remain in that room.* - He thought and stepped further into the chamber, across the lively water and onto the island.



*"Hello? Mister Wolf?"* - Sam said - *"Could we be reasonable here and just talk?"*

*What would that achieve?* - said a melodic voice, almost whispering to Sam's ear.

He freaked out immediately due to the unexpected change of expected events. His entire body shook out of fear as if a spider had jumped on him, he let out a very unmanly - *"Eeek!"* - and fell on the ground looking towards the spectral figure behind him. He tried to define the shape in front of him; it was quite difficult as the streak of light shone through the chamber blinding him.

*"My friends will avenge me if you kill me!"* - replied Sam with the characteristic ‘I am super scared’ high pitch in his voice.

*Kill you? I don't want to kill you. It is more fun to eat you slowly. First one leg, then an arm or two!* - replied the spectral figure just before bursting in laughter.

Sam's brain started to connect his memories with the current events, the spectre's voice didn't match the thunderous husky voice that caused shivers down his spine - *"Who... who are you?"*

The spectral figure glided away from the monolith, revealing a female shape wearing a mask that looked like a part goat part turtle creature. The spectre glowed with a pale silvery light once it reached the shaded area around the pond.

*I see you have finished the Earth trial. You are half way there!* - said the spectre encouragingly as she opened her arm, gesturing to something on the ground to stand up - *Didn't you have friends?* - she added casually to the conversation. The sand below her feet danced to compose six benches of intricate finesse and patterns indistinguishable from where Sam stood up.

*"Ye... yes? They are coming, will be here at any second!"* - he added. He had inflated his chest in an attempt to look more menacing to the spectre in the shadows, though he did it in an attempt to find his courage back.

*Good. We are waiting!* - whispered another voice on Sam's left ear.

*"Eeeeek!"* - he replied with the same manliness as before.

*Ha Ha Ha! This is fun!* - replied the spider spectre.

*"I... I... I saw you! In the trial just now!"* - replied Sam.

*Yes dear! Congratulations! Just a few more before we judge you and decide if you are worthy!* - replied the spider spirit.

*"Wha.. Ho... How? How are you here? You were in the trial! How did you get out?"* - replied Sam dragging his hands on the sand in an attempt to get some distance from the spider spirit.

***Primordials aren't restrained to their worlds, boy.*** - replied a voice from the shadows, deep inside the cave. A voice Sam's neurones have come to fear.

Sam had backed out as far as he could push himself away of the water and pressed his back against the cold surface of the monolith. He watched the spectral appearance of the wolf descend onto one of the benches and take a seat. His bright silvery eyes fixated on Sam.

*Dear... it is a little irrespecutful to remain on the floor when we are having a conversation. Could you stand up?* - said the spider spirit.

Sam immediately obeyed and stood up - *"What is going on?"*

*I see, we have a direct guy right here.* - observed the goat-turtle spirit.

***Where are the others?*** - asked the wolf spectre.

*"In the earth room... I guess"* - replied Sam.

***What's wrong child? Last time there was more fighting spirit in you!*** - replied the wolf.

*"... I am alone..."* - Sam began his explanation whilst he raised his hand to point towards the spider and goat-turtle spirit - *"But to be honest, these two spooked me."*

*Oh my! I am sorry!* - replied the goat-turtle spirit.

*Who would get spooked by two sexy voices whispering on your ear?* - replied the spider spirit.

*"Yeah, who would get scared when two apparitions whisper softly to you whilst they are wearing masks of weird animals and you are in a poor-lit cave, in which a spectre told me he was going to consume my light!?"* - remarked Sam.

*Oh my! You got a point.* - replied the spider spirit.

***What a wimp!*** - replied wolf.

*"Either way, why are you all here? I thought Mister Wolf here was going to tell me how I was going to be murdered if I don't get to the next challenge."* - continued Sam. His brain made the observation that he was a little too sassy for his own good, somehow the message had not reached his tongue.

All three spectres looked at one another, the wolf and the spider nodded to the goat-turtle - *You have reached the mid point in your journey to become worthy. Before you, and your friends, proceed we would like to assess your progress heading to your next and final challenges.*

Sam looked at each of the spirits, wondering what do they mean - *"I thought each trial was the assessment."*

***What did you learn in the water trial?*** - queried the wolf.

Sam remained silent an instance. He tried to get his memories in functional order from whatever just happened in his recent history. The phrase from the stone behind him surfaced clearly in his imagination - *"Master my inner struggles... I learn to trust my instincts. I learn to think clearly when facing a problem."*

***Excellent!*** - replied wolf.

*And what knowledge did you gain in my trial?* - asked the spider.

*"To be true to ourselves"* - replied Hannah walking down into the light, joining Sam. Amir walked shortly after.

*Welcome little darlings* - replied the spider.

*"Hey, isn't that the goat statue from the first trial?"* - queried Amir.

*Goat??? What do you mean goat?* - asked reproachably the goatish-turtle spirit - *I am supposed to be a sea turtle!*

*"But you got a thick beard and eyebrows!"* - objected Amir.

*Hey! That's offensive! Just because I suffered of a hormonal problem you should not make fun of my facial hair! Plus, what would you know about turtles? you have never seen one!* - argued the turtle half breaking down in tears.

***ENOUGH!*** - said angrily the wolf standing up. His bright silver eyes shone through the room, overpowering the light that trickled down on the children - ***Child, you are painfully disrespectful to us! I shall terminate the offence by taking your light!***

*Oh sweet wolf, you will not.* - replied the spider - *These two are just children, they will learn in time.* - she stated looking at Amir and Sam.



Sam's gaze travelled from the spider to the sobbing turtle and finally on the wolf. He could see how angry the wolf was, his fangs looked menacing. Sam kneeled on the sand and bowed - *"I am sorry for Amir's comment. He means well though his mouth is not connected to reason."*

*"HEY!"* - protested Amir.

The wolf spirit stared at Sam and letting a puff of air escape his lungs, he sat - ***Do not disrespect us again.***

*"We won't"* - replied Hannah.

Silence filled the room for a few moments, even the ‘squeep, bloop, splish-splash’ of the drops of water dropping from the ceiling decided it was better to not contest the temper of the wolf.

The wolf remained observing the children before raising his hand to command Amir - ***You boy, apologise to her, NOW!***

Amir understood the tone - *"I am sorry. If anything goes your mask looks amazing and I liked the imagination of mixing a goat and a turtle in a single mask. I mean, looking at this room, I can tell that you were one of the most beautiful spirits, in the room... depending on the room and who was in the room..."* - Amir started to realise his compliment attempt did more harm than good - *"I should just zip it, I am sorry. I truly am."*

The turtle spirit cleared the tears from her bright sky-blue eyes with her ghostly hand, the water droplets vanished as if these evaporated - *Thanks.*

*"May I ask a few questions?"* - characteristically queried Hannah who overflowed with curiosity. She proceeded once the spirits nodded back - *"Why do you wear these masks?"*

*It has been eons since anyone asked such a lovely question. We are known as the primordials. The first elders to ever roam these realms.* - started explaining the spider - *The six of us descended from the firmament before children of light walked on Dawn's soft sandy shores, set foot on the grassy prairie fields, admired the hidden forest or any of the other realms. We thought it was appropriate to take an animal appearance to guide future generations.*

Hannah's mind raced through the new information - *"Six of you? If there are four trials and mister wolf here, who's the sixth?"*

***Charon, the youngest of us*** - reminisced the wolf - ***He sculpted our masks out of the stone of this cave, on those days before he felt the need to be outside of this cave.***

Sam felt a hint of sweet memories in the wolf's voice.

***Enough of this! Time is of essence. I must not be entertained by mundane chatter. It seems you have achieved the required learning to go further, you must attain the glory of the trial of the air. We shall return to our resting.*** - replied the wolf standing off his chair.

Sam looked at the spectral shape of the wolf ascend towards the shadows and asked - *"Mr. Wolf? If one of you had a name, do you have a name yourself?"*

The spider spirit looked inquisitively at the wolf, he had stopped on the tracks to vanish in the thin air.

***Names? Ah yes! We had them once, but those names are long forgotten.*** - replied the wolf.

*"But you remembered the name of the sixth"* - continued Sam.

***Charon didn't like his animal form. He didn't like to be a sheep, instead he chose to lead them.*** - replied the wolf but, before Sam had an opportunity to dig more answers, the wolf disappeared; so did the other spirits.

*"Come Sam, let's take a look at the next challenge. I wonder if we will be able to fly there"* - stated Hannah as she walked followed by Amir.

*"Yeah, we should've asked why we lose our wings every time we get in a trial?"* - replied Amir engaging Hannah as they ventured further again towards the new path illuminated by a path of white candles.

Sam decided it was best to leave the room. He looked at the decorated benches that has started to sink in the ground as the magical structural integrity of the sand disappeared with the spectres. One bench had an emblem of a howling wolf, to its left the bench marked for the spider followed the bench of the turtle. To the right of the wolf's bench, Sam could observe a bench with a roaring tiger followed by a bench decorated with a bat. Opposed to the bench of the wolf, Sam saw a mess of sand disappearing, at the top he could barely pick up an emblem with three sheep getting shepherded up a hill. 

*"Oi! Are you coming or what?"* - asked Amir.

Sam looked at his friend and smiled. As he followed Amir, he wondered if the spectres were as good friends as his companions and decided it was better to leave any jealousy behind. He understood he wasn't losing his buddy to Hannah, he just needed to share his happiness.

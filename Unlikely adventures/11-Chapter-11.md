# Earth call

Shadows danced to the rhythm imposed by the light of candles surrounding the statue of the spirit of water, which oversaw three unconscious bodies laying in front of it.

The musical tempo for the imperceptible music was produced by the periodic influx of air rushing from the statue's mouth. The air was damped with moisture, millions of tiny droplets of water seen as the light shone through. Gave off the impression the statue was alive.

The gentle wind caressed the unquenchable flames clinging to the top of the candles, in a waltz in which gas particles barely touched each other. They danced swiftly passing from partner to partner as each little ball of plasma extended its proverbial arms letting the air atoms go into the arms of another flame.

A waltz that was about to end.

The infinitesimal droplets suspended in the air found themselves pushed out of the way by a single silent gust. It muted the unapparent melody.

The eyes of the statue flared up with a sky blue light and a soft stream of water emanated from the rock covering the body of the statue as if a liquid dress had been bestowed upon the object.



Sam recognised the soft sand on his back; he remained on it with his eyes closed resting from the exhausting challenge. The trial of water had ended.



*"Uh, uhmm, ouhm, uh..."* - struggled Hannah as her awareness overtook her body - *"something is crushing me"* - continued trying to move her legs covered by Amir. She kicked his legs out of the way reflexively.

*"Ouch!"* - he said, regaining his senses as the world slowed down its spinning - *"... I don't know what I ordered, but it was the last drink that did it"* - he said apologetically, feeling the symptoms of a nasty hangover after a particularly forgettable night.

*"Huh?"* - replied Hannah slowly gaining an understanding of the current world - *"... are we back? We are back!"*

*"Yes"* - replied Sam standing up leaning on the statue - *"I guess, we've beaten the trial of water."*

*"We finished the trial of water but my mouth feels so dry"* - said Amir sitting down, rubbing his forehead with both hands.

*"Gosh... You've been eating sand, Amir"* - said Hannah slightly rolling her eyes, similarly to a teenager getting embarrassed by their boyfriend. She stretched her hand to guide him to spit the sand away.



Sam looked at the door. He was slightly disappointed as nobody stood by its frame.

*"Before I came in here, there was a scary spirit outside"* - said Sam recalling the last events before he visited the dream world.

*"... what was that now?"* - said Amir regaining full consciousness at the mention of ‘scary spirit’ - *"is there a thing walking outside?"*

*"Yes, it said we needed to complete this trial"* - replied Sam, stopping short of adding ‘or it was going to kill us’. The thought was interrupted by the neurological connections between his hands and his brain. His hand felt the sand getting damped with the coldness of the water, running from the statue towards the door and down the stairs. He could hear the gradual sprinkle growing into a roar of a waterfall as the stream of water filled the floor escaping the room.

*"I guess we need to go out and check"* - continued Sam shaking off the surprise from his hand.

*"But you just said there was a scary spirit outside!"* - argued Hannah.



Sam used an irrefutable argument against Hannah, he shrugged and walked towards the door.

The inner chamber was empty. The stream of water running down had joined the pond but it seemed to not affect it in any way other than a subtle hue change, giving the water a milky blue colour instead of its previous clear state.



*"Sam?"* - said Hannah, pointing at him - *"Your chest, it's glowing!"*



Sam looked down, the bright place where his flame usually dances was beaming blue light - *Wow* - he thought for an instant before getting drawn to the monolith once more.

*"Are you OK?"* - asked Amir, getting closer to Sam's chest, filled with curiosity.

*"Yes, all good."* - replied Sam fixating his sight on the monolith - *"We should go down and check the inscription."*



Sam felt the strong call to the centre of the islet and moved mindlessly ignoring Amir's objections, his mind only registered *"you've lost it"*, *"if you need saving, I won't do it. No!"* and *"Please, wait for me!"*



To Amir's and Hannah's astonishment, Sam's body gained the ability to move through the cave avoiding common obstacles stretching from the inner chamber walls. Sam moved through the chamber just like someone would move through their house in the middle of the night to get a glass of water, that sort of geospatial awareness attained by bruising your pinky toe one too many times against the leg of an out of place chair.



The world was nothing more than a blur and a series of murmurs in Sam's head until he stood in front of the monolith. The world regained its sharpness and Sam noticed the hint of fear in Amir's voice as he commented on the current affairs.



*"S... S... Sa... Sa... Ssam?"* - stuttered Amir with a hint of fear.

*"Eeek!"* - added Hannah.

*"Sam!? your back..."* - said Amir - *"It is coming behind your back!"*



Sam turned around but it was too late, the spectre wearing a black wolf mask pinned Sam against the monolith, between an incorporeal arm and the solid stone - ***You have returned, Child!***



Sam's feet had trouble reaching the ground below him. His ribs ached with the pressure - ***I judge the soul of those wishing, no, aspiring for greatness... What have you done to deserve the title?*** - stated the spectre.



*"Let me..."* - Sam struggled with the words, he couldn't fill his lungs as the spectre pushed against him - *"... let me go!"*

Blue sparks flew off Sam's chest vanishing the ghostly creature away, dropping his body heavily on the sand. Sam felt the presence of the spectre in front of him; it hovered floating above the water, darkness covering most of its shape.



***You have gained inner strength to face me, child. Yet, you don't know how to wield it and you are nothing more than a frightened little star.*** - said the spectre, turning to face Hannah and Amir - ***Your friends... they have achieved nothing. They are not worthy! you shall leave them behind.***



*"Don't you dare!"* - said Sam, anxiety filling up his brain with irrational courage - *"The trial is done! If I did what you asked me, they should have a chance to prove their worth too!"*



The spectre reflected on those words - ***Yes... YES!*** - turned to face Sam - ***Excellent idea, child!***



*Oh no, what have I done?* - thought Sam.



***You lack numerous attributes, skills and knowledge*** - stated the spectre - ***I shall concede to your request IF you show me you got the necessary knowledge to succeed on the following trial.***



The spectre stopped for an instant, it knew it adds dramatic effect - ***The tablet behind you, child. The first symbol is water.*** *-* a thin smile could be seen under the mask of the wolf - ***What is the second symbol?***



Sam turned around to face the monolith, his lips moved swiftly reading the line `‘Vanquish your doubts, gain knowledge’` followed by a square filed neatly with four other squares of different sizes.



***What is the second symbol, child? Time is of essence*** - restated the spectre.



*Think Sam, think... it looks like... bricks! bricks in a box? bricks glued together? a wall? a trial of walls?* - Sam anxiety got the best of him - *what a lame name if it is called the trial of walls.*

Sam opened his mouth - *"Is it a wal..."*

*"Excuse me! It looks like rocks, one on another. The earth is the only natural thing I've seen with rocks arranged like that. If the first trial was water, the second one must be earth then. Am I right?"* - added Hannah applying logical thinking.



The spectre slowly steering its gaze until it landed on Hannah - ***Are you sure?***

*"Well, no. But it sounds reasonable to me."* - she replied.

The spectre paused a few instants, the grin was gone, a telltale it was defeated - ***Then proceed with this knowledge to the trial of earth, gain the wisdom of its spirit.***



Two streaks of yellow light appeared near the wall of the inner chamber, behind the monolith, revealing a long deep crack on the wall covered by boulders and detritus. Inside, the outline of another door.

Sam returned his eyes to the space previously occupied by the spectre, it had disappeared.



*"That was bonkers"* - said Amir swiping his forehead covered with sweat - *"I was just about to show it what I am made of!"*

Both Sam and Hannah ignored Amir who had started gesturing his involvement in a ferocious fight.

*"Thanks, Hannah"* - said Sam, ignoring Amir's statements as the trio walked past the first set of boulders - *"I think you saved me back there."*

*"You helped us first, you got us out of the water world and... Amir, would you stop it?"* - Hannah felt an urge to strangle Amir as he made sound effects of swords clashing with each other - *"You were hiding behind me! The whole time!"*

*"Just 'cause it seems chivalrous and respectful towards women"* - he said deflecting her comments - *"It needed to know to keep a clear language, that's all I am saying."*



Their proximity to the entrance sparked new flames to be alive, lighting the frame of the door and their next challenge.

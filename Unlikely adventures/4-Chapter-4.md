# Unplanned Parenthood

*The wind softly swirl over the dunes, picking up granules of sand to gently leave it on the surface of the water, to disappear on a 'gloop!' as the water claimed its existence on its infinite wisdom. Photons travelling through the dark vastness of space, reaching the atmosphere; some scattered in a deep blue spectrum, never to slow down (unless it encounters a dense magical field near an individual of the order of celestial Testudines with four elephants on its back)* - thought the Virgil, in an attempt to recover some of his infinite patience getting consumed by the minute...

*"Out of curiosity, did you know over-exercising some muscles can leave them with permanent damage?"* - said Virgil.

*"But we are sitting, doing nothing. We are just talking!"* - replied the children in unison.

*"Precisely, you are abusing a particular muscle known as the tongue"* - snarkily mentioned Virgil.

*"... But we just met?"* - softly commented Amir, feeling ashamed due to the impromptu scolding.

*"Just met? It has been four days! You two talked non-stop for four days in a row!"* - his spectral hand waving four accusatory fingers that looked more solid than before the scolding started. Again, he felt his patience has never been tested as much as now. He felt a glimpse of guilt when four big eyes looked at him  - "*I... I am sorry. Not my intension to be rude to you."*

*"No hard feelings man. So Amir, as I was telling yo.."* - Sam started

*"Focus!..."* - interrupted Virgil, if he didn't take advantage of this opportunity, he was going to be stuck here a few more years on these dunes - *"There are a few things I would like to discuss with you, if I may..."* - said rhetorically, in the subtle tone your grandma tells you it is 'ok to have dessert before dinner' but, you know the second you sniff some of it your life is over - *"(cough) Welcome children of the light! As I said before, I am your guide on this magnificent little world which you are part of... Yes?"* - said, taking a deep breath of immaterial air.

Sam's hand up in the air. There was some oddness of the last few comments from the spirit - *"Did you say we have been chatting for four days? But... the sun is still rising from when I first arrived!"**

**"Time is subjective in this world. I recall mentioning before, that we are at dawn; your beginning. The dawn of your story on these realms... press 'start' to begin if you may"* - explained Virgil, feeling he forgot an important part of the service he is meant to provide - *"You were brought here by fate, by the elders or someone greater... to help find the way back to the stars left behind. You woke up at a time the elders needed you the most, little lost stars."*

*"But we are just kids!"* - said Amir in a tone of voice suggesting choirs weren't one of favourite endeavours.

*"Oh, you are so much more, I am sure of it"* - while looking in his soul, Virgil pulls two bright spheres from under his robes, a child figure standing inside - *"grab these, get it close to your heart and feel its warmth."*

Each child took one sphere and naively, tried to embrace the child inside. The sphere seemed to dissolve as it got close to their bodies, like a bubble that becomes fuzzy when looked at from an odd angle.

Sam looked at Amir and nodding to each other, took the sphere close to the centre of their chest, melting away its barrier, joining their spirits. Their robes started to glow as energy, peacefulness filled their souls and warmth, which could only be described as a cup-of-hot-chocolate-on-a-cold-rainy-day-tucked-under-a-nice-blanket sort of warmth, involved them.

Amir felt a tingling sensation on his back and notice Sam had grown wings - *"Wow... how did you do that?"* - said pointing to Sam.

*"How did I do **what**?"* - replied Sam noticing Amir's wings - *"Woooow... how do **YOU** do that?"*

*"You are now capsules of the light and light is not bound to gravity. You are carriers of the lost star I just gave you"* - voiced the immaterial creature - *"now you need to fly home"*

Sam felt a heartbeat pulsing in his chest - *"and where's home?"* - said mind absently whilst trying to see his own back in an attempt to find the origin of his wings. We all know how successful we are trying to watch our own back.

*"Home is..."* - Virgil stopped, he knew expressing the full extent of its location was going to be meaningless - *"beyond a place known as Mount Eden..."* - his immaterial head turned around trying to find a beam of light - *"Ah, there. Can you see it? That's Eden.You need to take your people there. Your people was a proud race who descended from the stars, build realms out of these lands and tamed the magic in it. You are descents of astounding cosmical forces looking for a way to come back to the firmament... but for now, you two need to train for some time so you are well prepared for the journey ahead"* - finished Virgil looking inspired for a speech well delivered, the air was about to materialise to praise the performance that was utterly missed by the two children who had departed moments ago chasing butterflies or challenge themselves one on one.

Virgil dared not to turn around, his spirit did not want to face the harsh feeling of some sort of parenthood and advises lost to the thin air. A tear did appear around his deep bright blue eyes, but he was not crying... no... it just happened it started raining... on his face - he convinced himself it was just immaterial salty rain.

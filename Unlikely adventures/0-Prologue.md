# Prologue

Hello there!

Welcome to this strange and wacky story, so strange in fact, that I am not quite certain where to start...


I could initiate it with a humble: _'A long time ago and a place far far away...'_ or _'When I was young I meant the most beautiful light...'_ but, I am not that kind of narrator, I don't want to start this story with clich√©s.

The story I am about to tell is about sacrifice, friendship, admiration and a tad of perspiration. It is a story about how gorgeous the sky we sit under can be; a sky filled with billion-billion stars.

A story that makes use remember to _"Be humble, for you are made of dirt. Be noble, for you are made of stars"_ - Serbian proverb.

... keep on shining little stars.

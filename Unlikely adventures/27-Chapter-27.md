# Chiropteran discoveries

Sam battled his disrupted focus, feeling as if he had woken up from a heavy dream whilst he listened Amir and Hannah argue behind him. The cavern had that sort of atmosphere that is thick and soupy, almost as if the air had this off quality. It was that je-ne-sais-quoi that makes you think: If I start running, would I truly move somewhere else?

Sam rubbed his eyes in an attempt to sharpen his mind.

*"That spirit is horribl-OUCH!"* - said Amir rubbing his ribs, which decided to ache as Hannah's elbow left its vicinity.

Hannah shook her head in disapproval to Amir's highlights - *"What would you do if this trial is about respect, huh?"*

*"Yes ok, but... I mean... look at it!"* - said Amir marginally escaping a flying elbow directed at his ribs.

Sam inspected the statue in front of him and he had to recognise, the mask wasn't the most amicable to the eye.

The statue was sculpted out of the walls of the cavern. It looked like a creature frozen in time, frozen by a basaltic prison. However, the spirit's wings had a different appearance to the rest of the sculpture, it looked like a pair of fleshy bat wings, so fleshy in fact that it looked almost made out of skin or some sort of leather, even though it was made out of stone.

Sam continued to observe the figure, he found covered under its wings the contour of its arms. It was the sort of shape describing in details its thin and delicate extremities which ended with its fingers intertwined, connected just above its belly. There he saw razor sharp nails capable of tearing through anything with flesh.

Sam's imagination didn't want to focus on the terrible images meandering at the back of his mind augmenting his fear. Instead, he focused on the edges of the sculpture, metaphorically walking with his gaze towards the top of the wings in which he saw a sort of fur covering the spirit's neck. Not too distant from the neck, he found the spirit's haunting mask.

Sam's description of the mask would be, to the best of his verbal abilities, a hungry rabid bat, maybe a vampire. A creature of the darkness hoping to pounce and maul its victims body whilst showing its small set of sharp teeth. It would sink its teeth right into your neck like a person with self control issues would to a double fudge chocolate cake. Sam could not help it but he unconsciously brought his hands up to cover his neck and any exposed areas. Whoever sculpted the statue was quite skilled giving it such life-like quality.

Sam's attention was glued to the petrified creature. Anybody in Sam's mind would've understood why he walked from one side of the room to the other in an attempt to release the pressure casted off the statue's eyes. It was as if the statue was fixated on him. He waved his hand at the statue, sort of in an idiotic state, expecting some sort of reaction back. But something spooked him to the core.

*"... SAM!"* - said Hannah summoning Sam's distant attention to the physical world.

*"Huh?"* - he replied - *"What happened?"*

*"What do you mean what happened? Didn't you notice we were talking to you?"* - replied Amir - *"It was like nobody was home but the lights were on."*

Sam struggled to follow the conversation with Hannah and Amir. He felt the statue's eyes like daggers on his neck - *"Doesn't it feel different to the other ones?"*

*"What does?"* - replied Hannah distracted with Sam's distracted attitude.

*"This room, the statue, the lighting of it... Everything!"* - replied Sam gesturing to everything whilst he maintained his distance to the statue.

Hannah gave a concerned and furtive look at Amir. She needed to consort with him and his insights of Sam. Amir, unfazed with Sam's distant behaviour, didn't understand Hannah's secretive message.

 *"There is nothing different in here"* - added Amir who coincidentally expressed concern for Sam  - *"It just feels like any of the other ones."*

Sam observed both his friends for an instant. He recognised their caring anxiety, so he prepared to explained his perception.

*"Take a look at the statue! It feels like it is alive..."* - he added refocusing his attention once more to the features of the statue, perhaps a far away location in which the statue had its own voice. One that sounded foreign and exotic.

Sam's focus drifted once more, wondering where exactly were the pupils on those eyes covered by the spooky mask. The acute pressure was uncomfortable. Almost like that sort of itchiness you feel on your back before feeling a spider watching under your shirt, right before you need to change your underwear for clean ones.

*"SAM!"* - said Hannah once again - *"Snap out of it!"*

*"Huh?"* - he replied feeling confused - *"What did I do now?"*

*"Sam, you explained your experience in this room and stopped halfway through."* - explained Hannah - *"You just stopped. Stupefied watching that statue for five minutes!"*

"Huh? I... I didn't, did I?" - replied Sam in an attempt to bring some memories of the last few minutes and push the presence of the statue away from him.

*"Seriously? What has gotten into you mate? Do you like them ugly or what?"* - replied Amir. This time, he sounded noticeably concerned.

Sam shook his head, hoping to wake up from whatever trance he found himself in - *"Right, sorry. What are we doing?"*

*"Finding some clues, Sam"* - replied Hannah. Her voice carried hints of fatigue - *"It would be easier if we had a little bit of light but..."*

*"Right."* - Sam interrupted as he tried to focus on something else in the room, but for the first time since he could remember, his brain connected the fact that the room was unusually dark in comparison to the previous rooms - *"Huh, where are the candles?"*

Amir opened his mouth and closed it a few times. Amir wasn't particularly skilled at hiding frustration - *"We already had this conversation Sam. All the candles were knocked down by the current of air in here. That, or someone stole the candle sticks!"*

Sam's brain connected the sensations of his leg with the rational part; it reached to the conclusion the tingling sensation must be a stream of wind rubbing against his skin. He looked down and could barely see a powdery substance being pushed by an invisible force. A few feet away from his feet, he saw a cylindrical white stick - *"I think I have found a candle."* - and he crouched to pick it up.

The candle stick felt warm to the touch, its tip felt soft and malleable, as if it was burning before they arrived to the cavern. Sam's intuition continued to warn him against a prolonged stay in the cavern. His memory made him aware of the pressure on his neck, he was starting to get used to it - *It is just a statue. Just like every other challenge, it must be just a statue* - professed Sam in his inner thoughts.

The sound of a water droplet rippled across the room. Sam tried to see properly throughout the darkness, if only they had a little bit of light like Hannah suggested.

Sam's brain began to place the informative puzzle of their current predicament. The sudden realisation sent chills running down his spine - *"Uhums... Guys? If there is no light in the room... How can we see the statue?"*

Hannah immediately turned to face Sam. Her eyes wide open realising the odd state of affairs - *"That's... that's an excellent question Sam."* - she said trying to grab Amir's hand in self-reassurance. 

All three turned slowly to observe the statue sculpted off the wall.

Sam's eyes, once again, scouted the features of the statue with its fleshy wings, connected to the shoulders onto what seemed shoulder pads, the fluffiness of the fur around its neck, its long thin arms to the delicate hands relaxed to each side of the waist, its long razor sharp nails gave the feeling it could tear through flesh, or so wanted Sam to complete that thought.

*"Tha, tha, that's not right!"* - said Sam stumbling backwards as he tried to back away from the statue - *"It moved! The statue moved!"*

Hannah hopped away from the statue instinctively as she observed the figure locked to the stone - *"Are you sure? It looks the same to me."*

Amir had turned to face the statue - *"It looks equally horrendous as before."*

*"Sssssh!"* - commanded Hannah - *"Don't be disrespectful!"*

*"But, it is a statue! Just like the ones before!"* - explained Amir walking closer to the statue. He slapped its mask a few times with his hand - *"See? It is just a plain statue!"*

Sam remained on the floor, observing the statue with the same expectation a seagull would show when it just saw another seagull disappear from the water with just a ‘Gloop!’, the statue remained immobile.

*"Sam, is that a candle?"* - said Amir pointing to Sam's hand wrapped around a candle stick. He walked closer to Sam.

Sam had lost his words or rather, Sam found himself trying to understand Amir's source of calmness. He saw Amir take the candle off his hands to play with the wick to erect it and check its condition, then Amir drove the wick closer to his chest which was met with a spark that jumped from his flame towards it, igniting it with an orange flame that illuminated the room. A series of ‘skitch’ sounds sparked around the children; the cavern was filled in an instant, with light of a dozen candles laid on the ground. Its flames battled with the current stream of air rushing through the floor.

*"Oh, cool!"* - said Amir observing the set of flickering lights - *"Now we can see properly thy hideousness!"* - remarked Amir walking closer to the figure sculpted off the stone.

Sam returned his gaze to the statue on the wall, somehow the sight was so much worse now than in the darkness.

The light highlighted the sharpness of its fangs and nail, its flesh-like wings looked more fleshy and less stony than before. The statue felt a more real now than before when it was surrounded by shadows. Sam sat there, staring at the statue.

Hannah noticed the colours washing away from Sam's face and decided it was best to engage him - *"Sam? What is going on?"*

*"I told you already, all this feels different. I don't like it."* - mentioned Sam - *"I don't even understand how you are so calm."*

She crouched next to Sam to give him a warm and motherly embrace - *"Everything will be fine. You'll see we will complete this trial in no time!"*

Hannah let him go, he felt uncomfortable with the situation, he felt as if Hannah and Amir were looking after a frightful child. It was very off-putting because, well, he was a child, but so were they.

*"Come on"* - she replied - *"Let's resume the hunt for clues to get out of here."*

*"Wait..."* - said Sam as he realised the awful reality brought to him by the silent room - *"Where is Amir?"*

Hannah turned slowly to the last place she heard Amir complaining about the ghastly imagery, but Amir wasn't there - *"Amir?"*

Sam's inner thoughts ran wild, he imagined the statue descending on the distracted child like a predator would do to their prey.

*"Do not get close Hannah"* - warned Sam as Hannah roamed into the danger zone.

She dismissed Sam's irrational statement - *"It is just a decoration Sam. The most likely explanation is Amir is hiding somewhere trying to get a good scare our of us!"*

Sam observed Hannah stand on the same location Amir disappeared. His gaze moved from Hannah to the statue, it remained hung on its spot with its fleshy wings and fur around its neck, with its thin arms and thin hands ending on razor-sharp nails that are slightly raised, the fingers moving slowly as the statue's mask watched its prey right in its reach - *"Hannah! Run!"*

Hannah reacted to Sam's scream by turning to watch him as her eyes filled with fear and disappeared under a leathery embrace of fleshy wings.
There was no sound, just the statue crouched on the floor where Hannah stood just a moment ago.

Sam wanted to stand but his legs felt like its bones had vanished. With or without bones, Sam moved his legs to drag himself away from the figure in front of him.

His eyes were fixated on the unspeakable appearance unfolding its wings in front of him, its eyes locked on Sam. Silently the figure began walking slowly towards Sam.

*"Don't get close or else!"* - he managed to squirm.

The figure stopped its progress towards Sam and rolled its head on its right - *Or else what?*

Sam's thoughts struggled to organise a coherent threat in reply - *"Or else I will scream like a little boy!"*

The figure pushed one of its wings open to uncovered its thin hand, long fingers and razor-sharp nails. Sam knew what was going to happen next and he covered his eyes with his arms just as the figure pounced on him.

# Chiropteran discoveries

*"That spirit is horribl-OUCH!"* - said Amir rubbing his ribs, which decided to ache as Hannah's elbow left its vicinity.

Hannah shook her head holding tight her eyes - *"What would you do if this trial is about respect, huh?"*

*"Yes ok, but... I mean... look at it!"* - said Amir marginally escaping anything flying elbow.

Sam inspected the statue, he had to recognise the mask wasn't the most amicable to the eye. The statue was sculpted out of the walls of the cavern marked as the air spirit home, the spirit's wings didn't have the same appearance as any other wings he has seen before; he recognised he hasn't seen many wing designs in the past but, to be fair, he hasn't seen many children around either.
The sculpture wings looked like a pair of bat's wings, thin and almost made out of skin, or it looked leathery even though it was made out of stone. Sam could notice the arms under the leathery wings, the contour told him the statue had a slim figure ending on a thin and delicate set of hands, it fingers intertwined, connected just under its belly, revealed razor sharp nails capable of tearing through anything with flesh.
Sam's imagination didn't want to focus on the terrible images projected by fear and decided that his gaze should follow the edges of the wings towards the top, which was decorated with some sort of fur covering the spirit's neck, then he found the mask of the spirit.
Sam's best description of the mask would be, a hungry bat, maybe a vampire, jumping straight at you with its mouth open showing you its small set of sharp teeth, ready to sink them in your neck. He could not help but to bring his hands up to his neck and unconsciously cover the exposed area. Whoever sculpted the statue was quite skilled giving it such life-like quality, Sam noticed. He moved from one side of the room to the other, the statue's eyes gave off the impression of being fixated on him. He waved his hand at the statue expecting a reaction back, something else made him jolt on the spot.

*"... SAM!"* - said Hannah summoning Sam's attention from whatever distant world.

*"Huh? What happened?"* - he replied.

*"Didn't you notice we were talking to you?"* - replied Amir - *"It was like nobody was home but the lights were on."*

Sam could not focus on the discussion maintained with Hannah and Amir. He felt the pressure of the statue's eyes on his neck - *"Doesn't it feel different to the other ones?"*

*"What does?"* - replied Hannah distracted with Sam's distracted attitude.

*"This room, the statue, the lighting of it... Everything!"* - replied Sam gesturing to everything whilst he maintained his distance to the statue.

Hannah gave a furtive look at Amir filled with concern and in an attempt to consort with him and his insights of Sam, though he seemed unfazed with Sam's behaviour - *"I think it just feels like any of the previous rooms Sam."*

He observed both his friends and recognised their caring anxiety, he tried to explained his perception - *"But the statue, I mean, look at it! It feels like it is alive..."* - he added refocusing his attention once more to the features of the statue, perhaps a distant location in which the statue had its own voice, one that sounded foreign and exotic. Sam couldn't make the exact location of the eyes of the statue as the mask covered its face, but he could feel that pressure anybody feels when someone stares for too long, like that sort of itchiness you feel on your back before feeling the legs of a spider trying to escape from under your shirt.

*"SAM!"* - said Hannah once again - *"Snap out of it!"*

*"Huh? What did I do now?"* - he replied feeling confused.

*"Sam, you were explaining what is it that you are feeling in this room and stopped halfway through."* - explained Hannah - *"You literally stopped talking for five minutes!"*

"Huh? I... I didn't, did I?" - replied Sam in an attempt bring the memories of the last few minutes and push the presence of the statue behind him.

*"Seriously? What has gotten into you mate? You just watched the ugly one here and said nothing."* - replied Amir. This time he looked noticeably concerned.

Sam shook his head in an attempt to wake up from whatever trance he found himself in - *"Right, sorry. What are we doing?"*

*"Try finding some clues, Sam"* - replied Hannah. Her voice carried hints of fatigue - *"If we had a little bit of light it would be easier but..."*

*"Right..."* - Sam tried to focus on something else in the room but, for the first time since he can remember, his brained connected the fact the room was unusually dark in comparison to the previous rooms - *"Huh, where are the candles?"*

Amir opened his mouth and closed it a few times, then added - *"We already had this conversation Sam. All the candles were knocked down by the current of air here, I think. That or something stole the candle sticks!"*

Sam's brain connected the sensations of his leg with the rational part; it reached to the conclusion the tingling sensation must be a stream of wind rubbing against his skin. He looked down and could barely see a powdery substance being pushed by an invisible force. A few feet away from his feet, he saw a cylindrical white stick - *"I think I have found a candle."* - and crouched to pick it up.
The candle stick felt warm to the touch, its tip felt soft and malleable, as if it was burning before they arrived to the cavern. Sam's intuition continued to warn him about staying in this cavern much longer. He had begun getting used to the pressure on his neck - *it is just a statue. Just like every other challenge, it must be just a statue* - professed Sam in his inner thoughts.

The sound of a drop of water echoed on the walls of the cavern, it was hard to make its contours from his position. Sam's brain moved the few pieces of information available to him, composing a picture of the current situation and chills ran down his spine - *"hums... Guys? if there is no light... how can we see the statue?"*

Hannah and Amir sprung themselves upright to Sam's question. Hannah reached Amir's hand with hers and squeezed to feel reassurance - *"That's... that's an excellent question Sam."*

All three turned slowly to observe the statue hanging off the wall.

Sam's eyes, once again, began travelling the lines of the fleshy wings, connected to the back of the statue with what it seemed like shoulder pads, then the details of the fur around its neck, he looked down its long thin arms to the delicate hands relaxed to each side of the statue, its long razor sharp nails gave the feeling it could tear through flesh, or so wanted Sam to complete that thought.

*"Tha, tha, that's not right!"* - said Sam stumbling backwards as he tried to back away from the statue - *"It moved! The statue moved!"*

Hannah hopped away from the statue instinctively and watched the figure locked to the stone. She said nothing for a few seconds - *"Are you sure Sam? This statue is made of stone."*

Amir had turned to face the statue - *"It looks equally horrendous to me."*

*"Sssssh!"* - commanded Hannah - *"Don't be disrespectful!"* 

*"But, it is a statue! Just like any other trial!"* - explained Amir getting closer to the statue slapping its mask a few times with his hand - *"See? It is just a plain statue!"*

Sam remained on the floor, observing the statue with the same expectation a seagull would show when it just saw another seagull disappear from the water with just a ‘Gloop!’, the statue remained immobile.

*"Sam, is that a candle?"* - said Amir pointing to Sam's hand wrapped around a candle stick. He walked closer to Sam.

Sam had lost his words or rather, Sam found himself trying to understand Amir's source of calmness. He saw Amir take the candle off his hands to play with the wick to erect it and check its condition, then Amir drove the wick closer to his chest which was met with a spark that jumped from his flame towards it, igniting it with an orange flame that illuminated the room. A series of ‘skitch’ sounds sparked around the children; the cavern was filled in an instant, with light of a dozen candles laid on the ground. Its flames battled with the current stream of air rushing through the floor.

*"Oh, cool!"* - said Amir observing the set of flickering lights - *"Now we can see properly this hideous statue!"* - remarked Amir walking closer to the figure sculpted off the stone.

Sam returned his gaze to the statue on the wall, somehow the sight was so much worse now than in the darkness. The light highlighted the sharpness of its fangs and its nail, its flesh like wings looked more flesh and less stony than before. The statue felt a lot more real now than when it poked from the shadows. Before he felt the shadows and his imagination made him dislike the situation but, when this illumination he understood it wasn't just his imagination. 

Hannah noticed the colours washing away of Sam's face and decided it was best to engage him - *"Sam? What is going on?"*

*"I told you already, this trial feels different. I don't like it."* - mentioned Sam - *"I don't even understand how you are so calmed."*

She crouched next to Sam whilst giving him a warm embrace - *"Everything will be fine. You'll see we will complete this trial in no time!"*

Hannah let him go, he felt uncomfortable with the situation, he felt as if Hannah and Amir were looking after a frightful kid, or so he thought.

*"Come on, let's continue looking for clues on how to get this started"* - she replied.

"Wait..." - said Sam as he realised the awful reality brought to him by the silent room - "Amir?"

Hannah turned slowly to the last place she heard Amir complaining about the ghastly imagery, but Amir wasn't there - *"Amir? Where are you?"*

Sam's inner thoughts ran wild, he imagined the statue descending on the distracted child like a night creature would do to their prey.

*"Do not get close Hannah"* - warned Sam.

She dismissed Sam's irrational statement - *"It is just a decoration Sam. The most likely explanation is Amir is hiding somewhere trying to get a good scare our of us!"*

Sam observed Hannah stand on the same location Amir disappeared. His gaze moved from Hannah to the statue, it remained hung on its spot with its fleshy wings and fur around its neck, with its thin arms and thin hands ending on razor-sharp nails that are slightly raised, the fingers moving slowly as the statue's mask watched its prey right in its reach - *"Hannah! Run!"*

Hannah reacted to Sam's scream by turning to watch him as her eyes filled with fear and disappeared under a leathery embrace of fleshy wings.
There was no sound, just the statue crouched on the floor were Hannah stood just a moment ago.

Sam wanted to stand but his legs felt as if his bones had been removed. With or without bones, Sam moved his legs to drag himself as far away from the figure in front of him. His eyes were fixated on the unspeakable appearance unfolding its wings in front of him, its eyes locked on Sam. Silently the figure began walking slowly towards Sam.

*"Don't get close or else!"* - he managed to squirm.

The figure stopped its progress towards Sam and rolled its head on its right - *Or else what?*

Sam's thoughts struggled to organise a coherent threat in reply - *"Or else I will scream like a little boy!"*

The figure pushed one of its wings open to uncovered its thin hand, long fingers and razor-sharp nails. Sam knew what was going to happen next and he covered his eyes with his arms just as the figure pounced on him.

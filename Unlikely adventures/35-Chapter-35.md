# Cherry red scintillation

Amir felt the warmth of the red flame dancing in his chest, it felt somehow as if it pushed him to got further, though he wasn't sure where to - *"I don't understand"*

The Tiger bright amber eyes inspected Amir up and down - **Wut is it?**

*"Why has my flame changed in colour?"*

**You came here to get my blessing, no?**

*"I thought I came by force..."*

**Well yeah, dat too...** - answered the Tiger, there is a hint of apology in his tone, more like a pinch, more like a smidgen, really - **But you came to da cave seeking spiritual guidance**

*"I think I came following Hannah"*

**Boy... You make it hard to like you** - said the Tiger - **Da important fing is, you faced your fears...**

Amir raised a finger, but the Tiger continued talking

**Say anyfing wrong now and I swear I will sniff dat flame rite out of yah** - he waited a few seconds, the silence was almost tangible - **I was saying, fears have been faced and you took it in like a champ.**

*"That sounds either a little bit gay or like I received a shot for something"* - added Amir, immediately covering his chest as he picked up on the Tiger's angry eyes - *"It's just a joke!"*

**... You like horsing around, huh?** - added the Tiger - **Eider way, You gotta be careful wid dis blessing. Da oders stick to yah, but courage tries to challenge its bearer. Remember, fear is not gone, just waiting for anoder chance to strike.**

*"Can you be more ominous? How careful do I need to be?"*

**Very... You see boy, only da chosen ones come to dis cave. Wolf will tell yah to go up Mount Eden and help us reopen da gates to our elders.**

"Virgil told us something about taking the little stars to Eden."

**Who?**

*"Our spiritual guide"* - replied Amir - *"He is very tall, and thin and sort of old..."* - Amir felt he had offended the Tiger - *"But I don't think he is as old as you, I mean, he must be closer in age to me than to... Virgil is super pale. Dresses in just regular clothes but it has silver threads towards the bottom."*

**I fink I may know da bloke**

*"Bright blue eyes, kind of sort tempered."*

**Bright blue eyes? I don't fink I have seen a child like dat before. Are you sure?**

*"Oh yes! His eyes as brighter than the sky! Almost like two little stars glowing through his mask."*

The Tiger tried to remember someone matching that description, it has been centuries since the last time he saw any teenager or adult roaming around. He felt he would have remembered someone with blue eyes. The Tiger found himself lost searching in his memories when he felt the pressure of Amir's gaze - **I'm sorry. Where were we?**

*"We were talking about Virgil"*

**Not dat, I fink I told you 'bout Mount Eden.**

*"Yes, I need to remember not to lose this blessing"* - said Amir tapping on his chest - *"Mister Tiger, could I ask a question?"*

**Uh huh, shoot**

*"I thought you were different"*

**Dat's a weird question.**

*"Oh no, I mean, when you brought me here I thought you were going to attack me, or that you were going to eat me."*

**Wut? Why would I do dat?**

*"I don't know... the other spirits were very scary."*

**Do you want me to be scary? I'll show you scary!** - said the Tiger raising his hands. The ground shook and plumes of fire danced a few inches above the ground shaping up like unknown creatures.

*"Oh no, I was just wondering if there was more to this trial"*

**Don fink so, no. By da way, it was pretty cool dat fing you did back dere**

*"What?"*

**Da golem. You have quite an imagination**

*"Yeah, I can't wait to show it to Sam and Hannah"*

**How?**

*"I will close my eyes and think about it. The sand will do its thing, right?"*

**Don fink so.**

*"But I am sure I've done it before"*

**A golem?**

*"No, make the sand take the shape I wish or need it to be"*

**Where you in one of the trials?**

*"Yeah?"*

**Rite. Dat's your inner power. You can use it in here but it is hard out dere. If you had a wizard to show you how, but dere has been no wizard around for eons. Dey all dead.**

Amir felt disappointed.

**But if you restore da gate, maybe a wizard spirit will come back and show you how.**

*"Like Virgil?"*

**I guess so, it is weird dat Virgil guy. All spirits should be locked away by da charm of da Collector.** - added the Tiger - **In any case, let's go back. If we continue talking you'll get bored and I want to talk to da others. Tell your friends you had a blast here, HA HA.**

Amir saw the big grin on the Tiger's face. For such a large feline covered in flames, he was quite a good guy. Amir didn't think his movements and proceeded to hug the Tiger by the neck - *"Thank you for looking after me."*

The Tiger was surprised, in the moment, he let go his magnificent pose to embrace Amir, his paw covered most of Amir - *It felt nice having someone to give you a hug after a few millennia have gone past* - thought the Tiger.

Amir lingered hugging the Tiger a little bit too long, the Tiger spoke - **HUM! I fink dat's enough... By da way boy, do me a solid and don mention wha happened here.**

*"The clones of sand, the fight and the golem?"*

**Da hug. I got to maintain appearances** - commented the Tiger - *Plus da oder ones will believe I am a softy.*

*"Deal!"* - beamed Amir extending his hand.

**Wha's dis for?**

*"Let's shake on that promise!"* - said Amir.

The Tiger extended his very large paw, Amir had no idea how to wrap his hand around it so he just slapped it.

**Get on my back** - commanded the Tiger.

Amir followed the order and climbed on it as best as he could; it was a strange feeling, the flames felt quite real, but it was coarse, like touching the fur of a very large and wild cat, not that Amir has ever touched a cat.

**Remember to stay quiet. I don want to get lost again.** - said the the large feline before it flared on, breaking into full speed a gallop into the darkness. Its intense red light grew smaller and smaller, until it resembled a miniature star pulsating before it went in a ‘whooshhh’.

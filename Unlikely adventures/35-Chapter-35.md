# Cherry red scintillation

Amir felt the warmth of the red flame dancing in his chest, it felt somehow as if it pushed him to got further, though he wasn't sure where to - *"I don't understand"*

The Tiger bright amber eyes inspected Amir up and down - **Wut is it?**

*"Why has my flame changed in colour?"*

**You came here to get da blessing I guard by da need of helping your friends, no?**

*"I thought I came by force..."*

**Well yeah, dat too...** - answered the Tiger, there is a hint of apology in his tone, more like a pinch. A pinch might be too much, perhaps a smidgen, really - **But you came to da cave seeking spiritual guidance**

*"I think I came following Hannah."*

**Boy... You make it hard to like you** - said the Tiger - **Da important fing is, you've learnt how to face your fears...**

Amir raised a finger, but the Tiger continued talking

**Say anyfing wrong now and I swear I will sniff dat flame rite out of yah** - he waited a few seconds, Amir remained attentive with his fingers tucked in his garments - **as I was saying, you have understood fears are part of you. You faced them and you took it in like a champ.**

*"That sounds either a little bit gay or like I received a shot for something"* - added Amir, immediately covering his chest as he picked up on the Tiger's angry eyes - *"It's just a joke!"*

**... You like horsing around, huh?** - added the Tiger - **Eider way, dis blessing works in a different way to da oders. You gotta be careful wid it.** - said the large feline going around Amir - **Any oder blessing will stick to you, but courage is a tricky one; it challenges its bearer as time goes along. It is a confiscated blessing too, da attributes of courage are infectious... did I say dat right? Is infectious somefing like when you get a cough and puss and give it to oders?**

*"You gave me a disease???"* - replied Amir appalled.

**Wut? NO! I mean, if you are brave, it sticks to oders! It makes dem brave too! Dats wut I meant!** - the Tiger covered its face with the gigantic paw, he felt some of the red markings might be getting redder with his shame - **Look, courage is one of dose fings dat can be great to inspire anyone, but you gotta make sure to keep it up. Imagine wut would happen is da hero panics at da wrong moment! Remember, your fear is not gone, just waiting for anoder chance to strike back and get away.**

Amir weighted each word, understanding its meaning - *"Are you saying I could lose courage?"*

**In a way, yes. Even the bravest bloke will chicken out if a dragon shows up out of nowhere wid its pointy horns, and tries to ram ya over, right?**

*"I guess"* - replied Amir not sure what a ‘dragon’ is, probably some kind of goat given it rams people - *"So, How careful do I need to be?"*

**Very... You see boy, just a few come to dese caves and even less are chosen to get our blessings.** - the Tiger leaned his enormous head closer to Amir. Its voice was so deep, Amir could feel a rumble going inside of him - **I shouldn't tell you dis, but let me tell you da scariest part...**

*"No buts!"* - added Amir quickly in an attempt to keep his blessing a little bit longer - *"We are good, no need to say anything that will scare me!"*

**Look boy, dis is a story dat started a long time ago. Our elders were locked away, up at the top of Mount Eden; well wutever left of dem...** - the Tiger looked over his shoulder, checking if there was anybody else listening to their conversation, which was a silly assumption given they have been inhabiting in Amir's mind - **It is a very dangerous place up dere, full with terrible fings awaiting to dose foolish enough to go.**

*"... and we are the ones foolish enough, right?"* - added Amir, dreading the phrase that might complete the sentence.

The Tiger quickly realised his previous words, specially when Amir made its implication painfully obvious - **Not fool, brave!**

*"Same difference"* - replied Amir.

**Don't fink of yourself as a fool, fink bout it as, you are da chosen hero!** - said the Tiger giving it a positive spin.

*"The chosen hero... sound more like an unaware fool"* - argued Amir wondering if hero is just another word for someone that is fool enough to not measure how dangerous the situation can get.

**Dey are definitely not da same** - responded the Tiger.

*"How is it different?"*

**Everybody expects the foolish to run away...** - clarified the Tiger. To the Tiger a hero was something much more meaningful than someone throwing away their life. A hero was someone throwing away their life for a greater goal, like that guy who was an amazing warrior, but forgot to take a full shower, which proved to be fatal in the end as a smidge of dirt told the enemies to aim at his ankle, or perhaps it was his uncle; it wasn't quite clear to the Tiger. The Tiger's point was, if you are a hero you might get a weakness called after yourself, like Tennis elbow, Achilles' Eye or Polyphemus' heel.

It was very difficult for Amir to not stare at those huge amber eyes staring back at him. He knew the Tiger tried to encourage him, it didn't seem to hit the target quite like he expected it - *"It sounds the fools have some smartness to them."*

**Sum people say da truly sumone intelligent is da one who can pretend to be a fool** - replied the Tiger with humour. It didn't seem to have the reaction he expected on Amir - **Oi, don't worry. We test all of ya to increase da chance of you getting up dere, where you are supposed to be.**

Amir decomposed the sentence, he wasn't sure why but it felt like the words a general would give to the soldiers before they are thrown to the battlefield - *"So, how many have you send to Eden so far?"*

**Since ‘dose days’? I dunno, perhaps bout a dozen?** - replied the Tiger, trying to scrub the inner parts of his memories.

*"And nobody has freed the elders, right?"*

**Dats rite.**

*"And what are our chances to get there?"* 

**Artistically?**

Briefly, Amir imagined dancing at the top of a volcano about to explode. His brain had become used to the remapping of concepts to the nearest sound - *"Yes, realistically..."*

**One to a million!**

One million chances for him to get there against one to fail was reassuring odds, thought Amir - *"That doesn't sound so bad..."*

**No wait, I fink is da oder way around. It is a million to one.**

And the reassurance was utterly destroyed - *"Oh crap."*

**It is better dan nofing, if you fink bout it.**

Amir didn't want to think about it. The Tiger seemed to be giving Amir all sorts of valuable details, but the more he discovered the more he wanted to march in the opposite direction to the foretold mount. One thing Amir was certain was, he needed to mention all of this with Hannah and Sam.

**Oh, by da way, dis fing I just said stays here wid us, ok?** - said the Tiger, his incredibly large face watching the little child in front of his nose - **Aint supposed to say any of dis to anybody.**

*"I won't mention it to anybody outside of the cave"* - replied Amir missing the point entirely.

**NOBODY CAN KNOW. DAT MEANS NOT YOUR FRIENDS** - restated the Tiger. His large friendly amber eyes seemed to become brighter and menacing.

*"But, they are like, my best friends!"* - complained Amir.

**I said no-one!** - Amir could almost see flames raging behind the bright eyes, his claws began to show, slowly raking the soil.

*"Well, you actually said ‘nobody’..."* - added Amir, the Tiger's lip moved up revealing some pretty large and sharp fangs - *"But I get it, I shouldn't tell anyone about the dangers of Eden."*

**Ok, good** - said the Tiger extending his paws in a relaxed pose.

Amir was glad the intense glow in the Tiger's eyes had calmed down. It was like staring at two distant stars about to go supernova, almost like Virgil's eyes but amber - *"Now that I remember, Virgil mentioned something about taking little stars to Eden."*

**Da Who?** - asked the Tiger halfway through a yawn.

*"Our guide"* - clarified Amir - *"He is very tall, thin, kind of dead... sort of old"* - Amir felt he had offended the Tiger - *"But I don't think he is as old as you, I mean, he must be closer in age to me than to... Virgil is super pale. Dresses in just regular clothes but it has silver threads towards the bottom."*

**I fink I may know da bloke** - replied the Tiger rolling on his back playfully.

*"Bright blue eyes, relatively sort tempered..."* - added Amir to the description of Virgil.

The Tiger froze midway a scratch. Some elements of that description felt out of place. He searched through his memories - **Hang on, bright blue eyes? Pale and fin? I recon I haven't seen a child like dat ever before. Are you sure?**

*"Yeah?"* - replied Amir partially confused. There was a hinge of inquisition on the way the Tiger interrupted him - *"His eyes are brighter than the sky! Almost like two stars glowing from way beyond the mask he is wearing."*

The Tiger tried to remember anybody from the old times matching that description, it had been centuries since the last time he saw any teenager or adult roaming around, but the Tiger was confident of his memories, all tigers were known for unnatural way of archiving events in their minds - *A tiger never forgets* - thought the Tiger - *It doesn't sound right... maybe it wasn't a tiger, was it an echidna? perhaps an elephant?*

Thinking about which member of the family of the animals could claim the top spot for their memory was complicated enough, the Tiger had become painfully aware that wondering about this topics gave him a headache; which incidentally was the source of the pain component of his awareness. Unfortunately, the headache made remembering any details about anybody with blue eyes quite difficult - **I'm sorry. Where were we?**

*"Here in my mind"* - accurately pointed out Amir.

**Not dat, I fink we talked 'bout going to Eden.**

*"Yes, you said I could loose the blessing if I chicken out"* - said Amir tapping on his chest. His flame sparked red with each tap - *"Mister Tiger, could I ask another question?"*

**Uh huh, shoot** - replied the Tiger rubbing his back against the soft in Amir's mind.

Amir dragged his feet on the soft sand, the gesture said he was embarrassed but he said it anyway - *"I thought you were different"*

**You mean like a lion, sort of fing?**

*"No. I meant when you brought me here I thought you were going to attack me, or that you were going to eat me."*

**Wut? Why would I do dat?**

Amir looked at the large set of teeth decorating the menacing mouth of the Tiger - *"I don't know... the other spirits were very scary."*

The Tiger felt that Amir's statement were adorned with dissatisfaction - **Do you want me to be scary? Let me flex my muscles and I'll show you scary!** - he said raising his paws. The ground shook rhythmically to a dance of plumes of fire hovering a few inches above the ground, it took the shape of unknown pyrotechnic creatures.

They were quite mesmerising among the darkness around Amir and the spirit, it would have been frightening if the Tiger wasn't making sounds with his mouth after each new creature emerged from a gas vent.

*"That's cool, but I was wondering if there was more to this trial"* - said Amir after one final creature ignited after one particularly loud ‘**PHWAAOW**!’.

**Don fink so, no.** - added the Tiger scratching his gigantic head. The creatures vanished almost immediately - **Dat reminds me, da fing you did back dere was pretty cool.**

*"What thing? When?"*

**Da golem you summoned** - explained the Tiger - **It requires lots of imagination to pull dat off.**

Hearing the Tiger saying those words made Amir a little bit proud - *"Yeah, I can't wait to show it to Sam and Hannah."*

**How?**

*"I'll follow the steps I did before"* - Amir felt he had begun to understand the process to materialise anything our of the sand - *"I'll' close my eyes, imagine whatever I need and boom! The sand will do its thing, right?"*

**Don fink so.**

*"But I am sure I've done it before"* - he said stubbornly to the huge feline staring at him.

**A golem?** - checked the Tiger.

*"No, build things out of the sand. Make it take the shape I wish for or need it to be."*

**You were in one of da trials, weren't you?**

*"Yeah?"* - he replied with the same tone as you would when answering to your math teacher about to point an obvious mistake in your formula.

**I should explain dat to get it out of da way. Everybody has an inner power, making fings our of magic sand seems to be one of yours** - the Tiger had sat down. He wanted Amir to understand each word and he wanted to be careful - **You see, manipulating da sand is a tricky fing, you need to focus on each grain and command dem to play nicely togeder. Sum kids will be good at flying, oders can freeze fings whilst singing 'bout how da cold weader doesn't boder them.**

There was some paternal tone to his speech, Amir was fixated to the glowing cat - **Your skill is pretty good, but it takes time to perfect it once you are out dere. Dreams and reality don't follow da same rules.**

The Tiger scratched his chin considering Amir's options - **But a wizard can teach you, you know? Dey used to do great fings in the past, all you need to do is find one.**

Amir cheered up with wide eyes and a big smile - *"I just need one, huh? Where are they usually?"*

**Rite now? Probably spread on da floor of Vault. You see, Dey all dead, dey have been for eons.**

The cheerfulness overflowing from Amir disappeared. He felt disappointed.

**But dere is a way to bring den back. If you restore da gate, I am sure a wizard will come back as a spirit. Den it will show you how.**

*"A spirit? You mean like Virgil?"*

**I guess so, it is weird dat Virgil guy. All spirits should be locked away by da charm of da Collector.** - added the Tiger scratching his chin once more - **In any case, we need to go back. Da more we talk da greater da chance for you to get bored and annoy me. Besides I want to talk to da others. Tell your friends you had a blast here, HA HA.**

Amir saw the big grin on the Tiger's face. For such a large feline covered in flames, he was quite a good guy. Perhaps it was the moment, or perhaps it was Amir's involuntary reaction, but he found himself hugging the Tiger by the neck - *"Thank you for looking after me."*

The Tiger was surprised. He had let go his magnificent pose to embrace the little child hanging off his neck, his paw covered most of Amir - *It feels nice having someone to give you a hug after a few millennia* - thought the Tiger.

The hug lingered a little too long, each passing second changed the sweet smile on the Tiger to an expression of awkwardness - **HUM! I fink I am good.**

One gigantic paw carried Amir to the ground below - **Hey, could you do me a solid? Don't mention any of dis to your friends.**

*"Yes, you told me already not to mention about Eden. Or are you talking 'bout the clones of sand, the fight or the golem?"*

**I meant, don't mention da hug. I got appearances to maintain** - commented the Tiger - *Plus da Wolf might fink I am growing softer.*

*"Deal!"* - beamed Amir extending his hand.

The Tiger looked at the little hand extending up - **Wha's dis for?**

*"Let's shake on that promise!"* - said Amir.

The Tiger wanted to satisfy Amir. It was hard to imagine how Amir was going to achieve to shake his paw but he extended it anyway.

The paw was larger than Amir himself, he had no idea how to wrap his hand around such a large object and regretted having the idea. If the Tiger were to shake his paw it would send Amir flying through the air. Instead he closed his hand and bumped against one claw, sealing the pact.

**It is time to go back. Hop on my back** - commanded the Tiger laying on his belly.

Amir grabbed the flames of the Tiger, it felt coarse yet firm like touching the fur of a very large and wild cat. Not that Amir has ever touched a cat, but the feeling was very close. Once on top he didn't want for any instruction to hold on tight, he dug himself as far as he could into the Tiger's flames - *"I'm ready!"*

**Remember to stay quiet. I don want to get lost again. If you open yer mouth I'll leave ya on da side of da road. Now hold on!** - said the the large feline before it flared on, breaking into full speed a gallop into the darkness. Its intense red light grew smaller and smaller with the distance, until it resembled a miniature star pulsating before it went in a ‘*whooshhh*’.

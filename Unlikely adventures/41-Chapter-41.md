# Peas in a pod

In this chapter, we get to met Mathias' brother: Ishmael.

Ishmael gets introduced following the same description as Mathias, with the exception that he is flamboyant and cheerful. Later on we get to met Amelia, who happens to Ishmael's best friend and, for the most parts wishing to be reunited with Mathias as she has a not-so-secret crush on Mathias. She jokes with Ishmael tell him - *"Even though you two are identical, your brother has this... raw, strong attraction"*, he replies with "We look exactly the same" and she replies "Yes, but he likes girls and you don't" they both laugh.

Sunny walks in, he has the typical macho persona, he is covered in scars and other wounds as the tried to tame a manta. Ishmael attends to his wounds to what Tracy gets irritated and walks away. Amelia thinks it must be painful to be in love with someone who will never return their feelings, which is somewhat ironic as Mathias doesn't pay too much attention to her.

Sunny lays on the sand, next to Amelia. They stare at the sky and the clouds, one of the clouds has this funky looking twirl in it, almost as if a meteor punched through it. Amelia points towards another distant cloud with the same formation. They wonder what could be causing that odd behaviour.

Suddenly, from one of the distant clouds they notice a green winged boy landing with a thud on the beach. It was Paul. She smiles and says "hey"

Ishmael comes out saying "Hello Sailor" just to be restrained by Sunny, who's getting jealous. Paul compliments Mathias for arriving before he did, to which Ishmail replies "Do you know my brother?"

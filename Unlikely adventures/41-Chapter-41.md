# Peas in a pod

A boy, not much taller and not shorter than Mathias remained seated on a rock watching the indecisive nature of the ocean waves. To the casual observer, the boy was the spitting image of Mathias, though it is a little bit silly to think that way, isn't it? Anybody who has seen saliva resting on the ground can attest its lack of reflectivity and poor optical qualities.

In any case, the boy had the same constitution as Mathias. His body's main attribute was the broad shoulders; not too athletic, but certainly not overweight.

His face was framed by a graceful and carefully groomed hair, similar to Mathias', sort of rebel with a hint of laziness. He had the same eyebrows divided in the middle by the slightly aquiline nose; one in which you could squint a little and understand what aquiline means, specially when you are not sure if you are looking at a blurry version of a falcon, a hawk, or perhaps a kestrel.

However, in several other aspects the child lacked on some of Mathias' attributes. For one, his wings were primarily magenta with a smidge of purple and trims lime green. Under the right circumstances, it would give him the perfect appearance of an overgrown dragonfruit. In addition, each of his fingernails sported each colour in the rainbow plus some of his favourite, quite visible to anyone around as soon as he stroke his hair.

Another key difference between this boy and Mathias, he had a bright white smile.

But coming back to the original topic: indecisiveness, that's what occupied the boy's mind. The shore remained steady whilst the water ran a few metres on it, just to rush back an instant later making the characteristic whoosh as it retreated. Little white crabs emerged from their underground shelters when the sand dried up, confident the water had disappeared for good, just to be surprised when it rushed back towards dry land. It was a problem is memory analysed the boy.

*"Issy?"* - called a girl dressed in pale white and lilac wings from a near by grotto. The words reached Ishmael's ears, but if anybody wanted to talk to him, they better stand close to him. Who said a good conversation requires shouting?

*"Issy!"* - repeated the girl prompting her head from within the cave - *"Have you gone deaf?"*

He swayed his shoulders side to side with indignation - *"Glamour, darling. I would uphold my glamour before start screaming like a farmer who has lost a manta."*

The girl rolled her eyes taking the respective steps to close the distance between each other - *"Look! I found a few flowers around and decided to ink my wings with it."*

Ishmael turned almost instantly. The topic of colour usually attracted his attention - *"Ooooh, this is such a lovely colour! Do you have a few more?"*

The girl stared at his wings - *"I don't think you need any more ink. I mean, you look already quite dashing."*

Ishmael smiled, it was the sort of smile that usually appears when you are the subject of adulation - *"Not dashing... I look divine!"*

*"I am so fortunate to have such a friend with an amazing taste!"* - her words carried certain humour. The kind of humour evolved over several years of dealing with a personality who will never change, but you don't really want them to.

*"To die for!"* - he added, finishing the well rehearsed joke.

And both of them broke in laughter, it was the sort of laughter that slowly builds momentum, one in which one giggles and the other finds it adorable laughing out loud, creating a self perpetuating cycle. The laughter filled their corner of the world as it echoed through the enormous island, its very tall fiord, the arches of forgotten civilisations and some peculiar mounds with bubbling mud.

‘Whoosh, bloob, bloob’ - erupted a geyser breaking up the laughter.

The girl stared at Ishmael, her eyes displayed a sweet expression. He noticed a hint of lust in it - *"Stop looking at me like that, I am not my brother!"*

*"You look an awful lot to him"* - she replied with a melancholic tone added to it.

*"He better, that's what identical twins means, no?"*

*"Yes, but your bother has this... it is a... something very different!"* - she added, letting herself fall in the temptation of the memory.

*"I know, I know!"* - he raised his hand in the middle of the air, like a student who always knows all the answers does when the teacher asks an obvious question - *"Is it my astonishing taste in fashion? Or is it my animal sex appeal? Oh, I know what it is! He likes girls!"*

*"... It is like a raw, brute attraction"* - she heard the words leaving her mouth, reflected for a moment then gave a complicit look at Ishmael - *"I'm sorry, I don't know what took over me."*

*"Amelia, you incurable!"*

Both of them broke in laughter once again. The laughter echoed through the mountain, it reached the top from which a child zoomed past in close pursuit of a manta. The laughter reminded him of the pair below, landing close to them.

*"Whas goin-on?"* - said the newcomer.

*"Hi Sunny!"* - said Amelia.

*"Hgey señorita! Wha-re you two laughin about?"* - said Sunny, filling up his large chest with fresh air.

Ishmael noticed the tore garments - *"Not again! I have repaired that shirt twice this week"*

*"Jes, but I don kno wha happen, uh? Wan momen I was followin the manta and the other momen my shirt is broken. Wha're you goin to do, uh?"* - Sunny.

*"Seriously, you gotta enunciate. It is almost impossible to understand you when you are all hyped"* - Ishmael - *"Why were you chasing the manta?"*

*"But to tame it, of coarse"* - Sunny - *"Why would anyone chase a manta if they don't want to tame it?"*

"My point exactly" - replied the voice of girl, riding a manta which landed softly on the water. The girl had a big grin showing her achievements - *"You don't chase a manta, my dear Sunny, you claim it and ride it."*

Ishmael pulled Sunny's shirt, looking at a big gushes on the back of it - *"Look at this, it will look disastrous."*

Both Amelia and Tracy remained quiet in tranced. Some could even say, hypnotised with the view.

*"Girls?"* - Sunny called them back to this reality - *"Wha were jou sayin?"*

Trace and Amelia exchanged a complicit look - *"Nothing!"* - they said in unison and giggled to each other.

Sunny felt somewhat exposed and covered his chest with his pearl white iridescent wings - *"Ey Issy, while jou fix my garments, I'll go to that balder over there, to sunbath."*

Ishmael shook the shock out of him - *"Balder? Oh, yes, that boulder, yes"* - returning to the complex mental gymnastics of the most appropriate stitch that will hold such brute movements.

*"Jes, that balder, that's wha I said. Why do jou repeat at times, uh?"*

Ishmael once again felt drawn away from the world of mending and patching - *"Huh? Yes, yes, love you too. Go!"* - withdrawing back into his mind.

Amelia and Tracy knew quite well why Ishmael repeated himself, but in all fairness, it was Ishmael's fault was he never tried to teach Sunny proper pronunciation. They just remember the day he came into their world, shifting his hair our of his rugged face and slightly crooked smile as he tried to ride a coelacanth surfing the waves. They remember the wink he gave as he went past followed by ‘Olé!’. They didn't know what it meant, but it melted their world.

Their memory turned sour when they realised the olé was destined to Ishmael.

*"Life is somewhat unfair"* - said Tracy still staring at Sunny spreading his wings on the boulder.

Amelia's expression revealed a cheeky thought brewing inside of her - *"Let it go... One day you will find the boy of your life, just like he did."*

*"Oh really? And how's your crush for Matty"*

Amelia's expression wasn't cheeky anymore. If stares could kill, hers would've dispatched a trained army of assassins, followed by torturers and some lawyers; the assassins and torturers was the standard part, the lawyer was just to be nasty.

Tracy picked up her overall's suspender, it always had a dramatic way of coming off her shoulders when she wanted to contain her laughter - *"Any how, I am not as hung up as you think I am. I got me and I like me, that's all I need."*

Amelia swung the topic under the metaphorical rug - *"I might need to get some of that."*

*"Some of what?"* - replied Tracy fighting with the buckle of the suspender.

Amelia extended a helping hand placing the buckle in the right position - *"Like myself without waiting for someone else to like me back."*

Tracy was about to give Amelia the traditional compassionate gesture of ‘I am here for you brother’ by punching her arm, but she got distracted with Sunny's puzzled stare - *"Is everything alright, Sunny?"*

*"Jes, I think so. I  am hgaving trouble fucusing to those clouds over there. See? They are twirling as if a meteor or an asteroid punched through it"*

The clouds spiralled around a small object pulling its contents as the object threaded them around an invisible axis. It was fascinating, though as Sunny would soon find out, the event changed his composed pose to one of sudden realisation; the very same when you understand you are in the standing in front of a very angry bull about to charge. He saw with terror as the object, or rather the person sized projectile got closer, leaving a shock cone as it moved through the air - *"Look out! The thing is coming this way!"*

The landing shook the ground surrounding the nearby geyser, followed by a loud boom. It might have been a coincidence, but when Paul stood up the geyser behind him comically blurted out a large portion of mud, almost as if it complained about the unjustified punishment. Paul had his classic relaxed expression with a big smile and one hand up in what could be assumed, it was a sci-fi salute - *"I've come in peace! You know!"*

Ishmael emerged from behind Sunny, who heroically covered him from any debris launched from Paul's landing. Paul had a few bugs trying to untangle from his hair before he attempted to go again into the skies - *"And who might you be?"*

*"Wow! That's cool Matt, how did you get here before me?"* - said Paul filled with awe at the sight of Ishmael.

Ishmael jaw dropped a few inches - *"Wait, do you know my brother?"*

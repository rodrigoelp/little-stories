# Arrival

Sam's consciousness felt drifting in a sea of thoughts, senses settling down, getting sharper by the minute.

Some of the blurriness of whatever just happened was starting to fade away and the senses told him how the body was not quite comfortable... but it wasn't uncomfortable either. It was that sort of sensation felt when you spent the entire day watching movies on a sofa to the point your posterior hurt; you shuffled so many times that by now, you are sitting with your feet up in the air and you know in any moment your neck is going to start screaming in pain.

His senses tuned his mind, concentrated and focused his energy, slowly emphasising the environment, to be more precise, it has focused on the pain on his back and something that - *felt like a cold stone... as cold as... as something very cold and stony* - he thought.

He opened his eyes and was greeted by a very solid cold stone - *that explains it then* - he thought. The sun felt warm as it shone on his back, the breeze felt nice. 

Stretching his arms and jaw jawing, he could feel all the telltale of having just woke up from a really good long sleep and wished he had a blanket to tuck himself back to sleep... Grabbing a blanket, that is an odd thought - *What is a blanket either way?* - he thought as he started to look around disoriented.

Sam found himself on a small grassy island; it had a bit of sand, a big round rock on its centre with a constellation drawn on it, it looked like a big manta.

From it, a path suggested others have been on this same stone altar, walking towards one of the edges of the island to a stone frame - *some kind of a gate or portal* - he thought, as he examined the drawings on it; he could not make some of the images but, from the altar as his little pedestal he admired the mirage contained by it: a ghostly image, dancing side to side. He tried to understand the image in it, too fuzzy to comprehend.

He gave a few steps closer to it, a melody started playing. A few steps more and the imagery was less fuzzy. It looked like a shore of sorts and it sounded like birds filled it with chirps.

Three or four steps more and the melody seems to invite him over, the image was clearer, some sort of desolated island, different to the one he was standing on. From here, the portal looked a bit different, the drawing at the top looked like a face, like the face of an old man. It seems to follow him with its gaze as if the drawing was judging him.

*"Hello?"* - said Sam to face. There was no reply. He turns around to check if he was alone, the island was deserted except for his little flame. 

He thought - *a few steps closer and I might be able to see what's on the other si...*

The thought was interrupted as his absent mind, absent from the coordination needed to walk, with superb assistance of gravity made his world spin calling him to embrace his fate... that's the most poetic way to say he stumbled with a rock, sending him tumbling down the path into the ghostly imagery contained in the portal.





Unknown to Sam, there was another spectator on the island and it had been abruptly woken up by the sudden kerfuffle. The rock was resentful of the kick it had received when its attention was focused on watching the ice of a glacier melt, a glacier which was about to form at any point now but it may have missed it because a kid with its brute force tried to dislodge it from its resting place and a fabulous view of the sea.

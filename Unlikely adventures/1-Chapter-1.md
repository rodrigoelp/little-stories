# Arrival

Sam's consciousness drifted in a sea of thoughts, senses settling down, getting sharper by the minute.



Some of the blurriness of whatever just happened started to fade away and the senses told him how the body was not quite comfortable... but it wasn't uncomfortable either. It was that sort of sensation felt when you spent the entire day watching movies on a sofa to the point your posterior hurt; you shuffled so many times that by now, you are sitting with your feet up in the air and you know in any moment your neck is going to start screaming in pain.



His senses tuned his mind, concentrated and focused his energy, slowly emphasising the environment, to be more precise, it has focused on the pain on his back and something that - *felt like a cold stone... as cold as... as something very cold and stony* - he thought.



He opened his eyes and was greeted by a very solid cold stone twisting his neck added by a law attracting apples towards the ground - *that explains it then* - he thought as he stretched his back, sitting straight looking around. The sun shone through the clouds, his face greeted the warmth it projected and the breeze felt refreshing.



A yawn clouded his eyes with a tear or two as his mouth made the most peculiar sound - "Aaaahhhhhhh-hhaaaaaa" - he could feel all the telltale of having just woken up from a really good long sleep and wished he had a blanket to tuck himself back to sleep.

Pausing for a moment - *Grabbing a blanket, that is an odd thought,  What is a blanket either way?* - he thought and started inspecting disoriented his surroundings as someone filling particularly peckish would check a partially empty fridge just containing a jar of water and Chinese food of an unknown expiration date.



Sam found himself on a small grassy island surrounded by not much other than water, as islands do. The grass felt soft to the touch, almost like a carpet covering coarse sand making up the bulk of the island. At its centre, the island had a round flat rock, carved with a series of dots connected by lines, filled with a white powder; it resembled a constellation - *it looks like a flying manta* - thought Sam looking at the drawn creature with its distinctive swept-back aquatic wings and thin long tail.



From the altar, a path suggested other inhabitants have been on and about, walking towards one of the edges of the island to a stone frame - *some kind of a gate or portal* - thought Sam, as he examined the drawings on it; he could not make some of the glyphs on it but, from the altar as his little pedestal he admired the mirage contained by it: a ghostly image, dancing side to side. 

He tried to understand the image in it, too fuzzy to comprehend.



He gave a few steps closer to it, a melody played invitingly. A few steps more and the imagery was less fuzzy. It looked like a shore of sorts, filled with the chirping sound of birds.

Three or four steps more and the melody seems to invite him over, the image was clearer, some sort of desolated island, different to the one he was standing on. From here, the portal looked a bit different, the drawing at the top looked like a face, like the face of an old man. It seems to follow him with its gaze as if the drawing was judging him.

*"Hello?"* - said Sam to face. There was no reply. He turns around to check if he was alone, the island was deserted except for his little flame. 

He thought - *a few steps closer and I might be able to see what's on the other si...* - The thought was interrupted as his absent mind, distracted from the coordination needed to walk, with superb assistance of gravity made his world spin in an embrace with fate... that's the most poetic way to say he kicked a rock, tripping, sending him tumbling down the path into the ghostly imagery contained in the portal.





Unknown to Sam, there was another spectator on the island, woken up abruptly by the sudden kerfuffle. It wasn't a traditional spectator as this one belong to the order of inanimate-yet-temperamental sort of characters.

The rock felt resentment of the impromptu kick that woke it up from its trance like state, when it focused on watching the ice of a glacier melt (a glacier which was about to form at any point now these next few eons) but it may have missed it because a kid with his brute force tried to dislodge it from its resting place and a fabulous view of the sea.

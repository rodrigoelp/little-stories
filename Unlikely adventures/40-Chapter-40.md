# Dark waters

Sam felt the muscles around his neck relax with every passing minute under the warm sun and the gentle breeze rubbing against his skin, it was an awful shock to find Yule's sobbing in such a heart felt manner, tucked away near a crevice back in the cave. Sam knew he didn't spend enough time talking to her to form an idea of her personality, but she had that sort of ‘can do’ attitude which was completely absent when they reunited. Now that he remembered it again, he may have been feeling more stressed thanks to Amir who had been making kissing noses whilst pointing at Yule as Sam dragged her out of the cave. He wanted to have a conversation with Amir about the sensible timing to joke around, and he was feeling his fist had a thing or two to say to Amir's face.

However, Yule's sobs had come to an end as she remained in a deep state of trance, staring at the placid water of the temple's pond. Sam tried to remember the jolly expression she had back at the trial of water, instead the fresh memory of her completely broken and weeping came up. He wondered why the departure of the spirits had such a profound impact on her.

*"And those purple ones over there are water lilies too, right?"* - queried Amir in an attempt to ease the heavy atmosphere around them.

Yule nodded.

*"Fascinating... all of those over there are water lilies"* - Amir wasn't a big fan of prolonged silences.

Hannah felt the intense pressure projected from Sam. It was the sort of mood anybody would get when you arrive home with a friend and your parents pull out the photo album to showcase one particularly embarrassing story and you began to wonder under which conditions would spontaneous combustion would be considered unaided and spontaneous.

*"That's enough Amir, you have asked about every single plant floating on the pond"* - complained Hannah.

*"Better be informed, don't you think?"* - he added.

*"About aquatic vegetation?"* - she refuted.

Uncharacteristically, Amir gave it a thought before replying - *"Why not? I may have different interests including buoyant vegetation! It is important to expand one's horizons!"* - or maybe not.

Hannah gave a suspicious inspection to Amir's behaviour, something was outside the norm - *"Show me your hands..."*

*"Why?"*

*"I need to know if you took Tiger's dictionarium manuale..."* - Hannah stopped herself from finishing the statement. She noticed out of the corner of her eye Yule's expression changed as the pain of the events reminded her of the sudden departure.

*"Oh, no, no. I didn't meant to..."* - she tried to apologise but gave a nasty look at Amir, the message was clear ‘This was your fault’.

*"Are you sure all these plants are water lilies?"* - asked Amir in an attempt to bring Yule's concentration away of the source of her pain.

Sam seemed to recognise Amir's helping attitude. His execution was flawed most of the time even though his heart was in the right place.

*"Amir!"* - said Hannah at the edge of snapping at him and gave a meaningful look to Sam; it was a sort of plead ‘Help me get your friend to stop crying’. Sam misunderstood the telepathic message as ‘a grain of sand may have flown into my eye’ or the most likely scenario ‘I am about to kill Amir’.

Sam patted Amir's back - *"Hey bud, I think I am about to go check out the temple."*

*"Yeah, Ok"* - replied Amir, wondering why the sudden friendliness. Perhaps Sam received the known ‘nature's call’ - *"I guess I'll see you around, let me know if there is anything cool to check out."*

*"I mean, it would be so much better if we investigate it **together**"* - reinforced Sam plainly.

*"Really?"* - said Amir, thinking how many children do you need to check an old temple, He knew girls often would go to such endeavours together, but never, not even once he felt compelled to attend to such gatherings.

*"Yes, really"* - Sam togged Amir's arm and dragged him away from the vicinity of the pond and into the temple.

Hannah observed the pair slowly disappear into the overly large entrance of the temple, at least Sam had managed to diffuse one of her many worries. Hannah didn't want to admit it, but she felt uncomfortable around Yule, specially since Hannah wasn't great at dealing with other's sentiments.

Yule cleared up the tears of her face and took a deep-yet-somewhat interrupted breath. The same kind you take to tell yourself ‘even if it doesn't feel alright right now, it will be at some point’.

The breeze fumbled with Yule's hair, or rather with the few fibres that have managed to escape the orderly formation of her braids. Hannah couldn't stop herself from admiring Yule's pristine decoration of her attire or her wings: the shiny pink laces and sporadic feather with hot pink and red edges, her dress followed every guidance required for expert flying leaving nothing out of place; if you gave her a spear she would be the personification of a warrior goddess.

*"I wasn't expecting to see you at the water trial"* - commented Yule - *"Or I should say, seeing your body on the ground at the water trial."*

Hannah's shock was anything but discreet, a hypothetical narrator would have said ‘busted!’ right at that second - *"When did you-"* - she organised her thoughts yet Yule continued over her question.

*"I was curious about those two. They have certain something with them and I felt curious"* - she answered. Hannah felt that awkward sensation you got after talking with Yule for a while; She always seemed to know the answers of every question you haven't formulated yet.

*"So I guess you have an interest-"* - Hannah attempted to ask, Yule interrupted her once more.

*"In them? Yes, but I believe they do not have a particular interest in following me or my advice"* - she answered the incomplete question and the question Hannah was about to phrase.

*"Which is?"* - added Hannah. Yule's stare shifted from a flowered austral brooklime to Hannah's eyes. Hannah had rarely felt this exposed in her life, it was a sight that studied the most imperceptible movement and could understand the most complex scenario within just a few seconds.

To Hannah's surprise, Yule didn't make a comment and returned to her meditative state, looking at the pond. It took her a few minutes of silent meditation before she said anything - *"Do they know?"*

Yule's voice drew out Hannah back onto the present - *"Know what?"*

*"That you aren't as young to this world as they may believe"* - she explained, still focused on the brooklime and the tiny white flowers of the glossostigma below it.

Hannah didn't answer, she squeezed her hands tight.

*"Though age is rarely important for us, you might want to tell them about your previous experiences"* - Yule's body language would tell you she was absent from the current conversation, if it wasn't for her mouth.

*"Why is that important?"*

Yule turned to Hannah - *"He won't mind that you had friends before-"*

*"What is past is past"* - interrupted Hannah feeling Yule's soft nature had begun to rub the wrong way on her nerves. Hannah expected a witty comment from Yule, but it didn't emerge; she remained quiet, staring at the calmness of the water and possibly, some other flower.

Hannah, just like Amir, always felt uncomfortable when someone else was utterly silent. She felt even more so with Yule around, she knew Yule had the inner working to analyse everything you said and everything you didn't.

Hannah recalled a distant memory, the last time she ever saw Yule and had a conversation with her. She remembered Yule and her group venturing deeper into the Golden City ruins, now known as the Golden Wastelands. At that time, Yule advised her to take future events a little less personal; somehow she knew her friends were going to desert her in the middle of the desert, or rather, the sand dunes.

*"Didn't you have a tall girl with you?"* - she remembered a scary looking girl dressed in black and long dreadlocks.

*"Yes, I did"* - replied Yule - *"And I still do. But they would be waiting for us somewhere around the town in Prairie."*

Hannah reflected on ‘they’ and concluded she most be referring about the tall boy with green wings and the well trained muscled boy wearing a crimson scarf. Hannah limited to reply a dull - *"I see."*

It was a little too dull, it bothered her - *"What does the city in Eden looks like?"*

Yule remained silent.

*"I imagine the city is fantastic. You can see it from every single realm, but getting up there must be really hard."* - continued Hannah trying to break the ice - *"Out of every single group I've met you must be the first ones there, right?"*

Yule impervious concentration became pervious - *"I don't know what it looks like. We never made it that far."*

Hannah couldn't believe her eyes, Yule swayed uncomfortable on the bench - *"Hannah, there are some... things hidden in Wasteland and the ruins of the city. As we got closer to the entrance of the library, the things became alive and attacked us."*

*"What things?"*

Yule gave a meaningful look to Hannah, it had pain and unpleasantness, but she wanted to let her know - *"Some called them dragons. They would emerge from the foul greasy waters making a horrible sound, let metal skidding on dinner plates."*

She paused, if only for an instant to endure the awful memory that gave her chills down her back - *"You are fortunate your friends didn't drag you closer to the entrance. We barely escaped..."*

*"I wouldn't call it fortune. They left me in the middle of nowhere surrounded by that putrid smell of the decaying matter of the puddles or lakes of Wasteland"* - resented Hannah - *"I came back to get the blessings, just like you did, to go back and give them a piece of my mind."*

It wasn't just the way Hannah said things, Yule could appreciate the sentiment buried deep inside of her - *"I think it would be better for you to let go of those feelings. Chances are you will not see them ever again."*

Hannah felt annoyed at Yule, she was right, deep inside of her Hannah knew she needed to let the negative feeling go. It was Yule's last few words entrenched in Hannah's mind - *"Why wouldn't I see them again?"*

Yule understood Hannah wasn't paying attention at some of her warnings, she needed to explain things stating facts - *"The dragons, I told you about them. They would emerge from under your feet, dripping that foul black goo that burns your skin and pierces through your wings. They are merciless. Once they set their red eyes on you, they will hunt you down; if you manage to hide, they will screech and summon more of them until you are surrounded."*

Yule wanted to stop, but she noticed Hannah was indeed paying attention - *"We.... We only made it out of the Wastelands because one of us stayed behind... and it was my fault Hannah, I couldn't hide as quickly as I should've, the dragon launched its attack, I saw the wall of sharp horns coming my way and he pushed me out of the way. I saw him lose his last breath, I saw his flame..."*

Once again Yule's chest filled up with the painful sorrow of those who are missed, new tears began to flow down her face.

Hannah didn't need to hear the rest of the story, not that she thought there was much more to tell. She wanted to help ease out Yule's current experiences, but it was awkward to console Yule, or anybody else as a matter of fact, Hannah never had a good contact with that part of her personality. Hannah observed Yule withdrawing her legs closer to her chest and wondered why do we always assume that position when we feel the most vulnerable? It doesn't matter now, Hannah had mindlessly sat down next to Yule, in an attempt to find words of solace and push the pain away, but the words didn't materialise with her voice. Hannah's mind was blank. Through the narrow space between Yule's arms and legs, Hannah saw her tears getting fatter and heavier. Hannah couldn't help to wonder how much water was there in Yule, given she was such a small container for it.

*"That much salt can't be good for those fish"* - said Hannah's mouth automatically before her brain engaged the phrase, analysed it and decided it was best to not say it. She hated herself for saying such an insensitive thing. Clearly she has been hanging a little too much with Amir, her manner of speaking without thinking rubbed on her, or so she wanted to believe.

Hannah heard the gurgling sound of Yule's stuffy nose, clearing a path in-between sobs.

*"Wha?"* - Yule asked.

*"The salt, in your tears... these fish like fresh water..."* - panicked Hannah scrambling for words - *"Look, I don't know. I just wanted to get you somewhere else to make you stop crying, to make you feel better..."*

Yule tilted her head analysing her explanation - *"And that was the best you came up with?"*

*"Sadly, yes..."* - Hannah embarrassment made her laugh nervously - *"but it sort of worked, didn't it?"*

Yule raised her hand to touch her soft face, even though she still had tracks left behind by some tears, there was no sign of new ones rolling down her face - *"I guess so, ha!"*

Yule began to giggle, it was a gentle one, the type you share with your uncle after he told you an inappropriate joke in an awkward situation. Hannah continued to laugh nervously in Yule's company. A few moments later, they couldn't remember why they were laughing, they just knew it was better to forget sensitive subjects for the time being.

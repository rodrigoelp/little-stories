# Ignition

Flames roared loudly around Amir, clouding his view from anything around him. He felt like a meteor burning up in an intangible and unpalatable atmosphere.

*"Mister, are you still there?"* - Amir clenched his fingers hoping the pressure would tell him if he still had a firm grip on the Tiger.

**Just a moment. We are 'bout to get der** - Amir registered the voice from inside his skull.

The bright streaks of light kept Amir completely disoriented. He didn't know if they were travelling, standing or what. He only knew his body felt like it was squeezed through a narrow passage of bright red and orange flames.

**Oh... one sec...** - said the Tiger.

The flames around Amir shone brighter than before, streaks of yellow painted bizarre lines ahead of him. Amir rose his free hand, or he thought he did, he couldn't see anything other than the intense light blinding him. The flames surrounding him overwhelmed his senses.

*"How come the flames aren't burning me?"* - asked Amir.

**Huh?** - said the Tiger as his primary focus was deviated by Amir's question - **You should know dat; flames do not burn da children of da lite... Where was I? Oh yeh, dis way...**

Amir had noticed the raging flames acquired a degree of tranquility when he Tiger replied one of his questions. He couldn't figure out if he was holding the Tiger's hand, grabbing to his garments or being tossed through the air - *Was I holding him with my right hand or was it my left?* - The bright orange light changed slowly to deep reds.

*"Yellow and red goes really well together, huh?"* - asked Amir.

The raging flames calmed down - **Wut?**

*"I said I liked the red and yellow colours."* - explained Amir - *"If I could I would wear those colours, so when I fly past some people they would"*

**Too much information** - interrupted the Tiger. There was a hint of annoyance in his voice - **Gimme sum silence, please.**

The chaotic movement of plasma returned to its active state, or so noticed Amir. He wanted to stay silence, but what can an hyperactive boy do when all there is to do is to watch flames go by? Normally, Amir would have felt the passage of time as if every single second had been stretched into minutes, but waiting in silence made each second feel like it took decades.

*"I'm here... waiting..."* - eagerly awaited Amir.

**Wait! I missed it again?** - said the Tiger to himself.

*"... quietly..."* - continued Amir and his commentary, showing the same restraint as a three year old after eating too many lollies - *"In total and utter stillness of the silence of the night, day, midday?"*

The passing flames slowed down significantly, almost frozen in place - **I MISSED DA DAMNED EXIT AGAIN!**

*"What exit?"* - inquired Amir.

**Boy, be quiet!** - replied the voice of the Tiger getting increasingly annoyed.

*"What happened?"*

**I need to... concatenate here!**

*"You mean, concentrate?"*

**Shuddap!** - replied the Tiger even more annoyed than before - **You'll make me crash!**

*"I just wanted to know where are you taking me?"*

The flames continued to roar around Amir's ears, legs, arms, upper body, lower body and the rest. It would have been easier to just say, the flames roared loudly around Amir.

**... to da inner parts of your brain.** - the Tiger struggled to keep calm but he was too annoyed at the constant squabbling - **You know, in your head.**

Amir felt the tone of the answer had the subliminal message of ‘ask me one more thing and I will leave you to the side of the road’, so he fought his impulses and tried to remain soundless.

The flames raged on, but the composition of the flames changed slowly from the warm palette of reds and yellows to streaks of blue and pinks.

**Finally!** - said the Tiger filled with solace - **I fink I've found da spot!**

*"Which spot?"* - asked Amir.

**Da one you use to hide your biggest fears!** - answered the Tiger, instants before the plasma blinding Amir's field of view became clear, giving him for the first time a panorama of the action.

Amir rode the Tiger all the way down to the ground, and by rode, Amir was riding a large feline creature covered in black and orange stripes wearing the mask of the Tiger. Each metre closer to the ground welcomed them with a black fog becoming denser and denser.

A gentle crunch let Amir know the Tiger had landed on the ground. The fog had become so thick they couldn't see farther than a few feet ahead from them. Even the flames of the Tiger seemed to choked by the nothingness around them.

*"Can you see anything?"* - asked Amir squinting as if the act of closing your eyes might improve his perception at night. He really tried to make the contour of the nothingness around him, just the glow of the Tiger and his bright amber eyes were his companion.

**You must be really scared, huh?** - replied the Tiger gently leaning forward so Amir could unmount him - **You see, you build dis side and I've got little to no control over here.**

The Tiger opened his mouth expelling large streams of flames that quickly vanished or choked out of existence - **I wished der was anoder way to test ya. I really don't like dis place.**

*"What should I do know?"* - Amir remained unsure, he hoped the trial consisted on walking around in a maze, swimming on some sort of cold water or whatever Sam had to do with the little girl.

**It is all different to each guy, or girl I bring here, ya know?** - the Tiger was noticeably apprehensive, adrenaline rushed through his phantasmagorical being - **Some times it is really tall places; some oder times is an animal chasing ya. Once it was the buggy monster, it was rader strange dat one... da kid had no bed!**

Amir imagined a monster with four large wheels instead of limbs, then his brain found the matching homophone for boogie. A large ‘gulp’ made the Tiger turned to look at Amir - **Now dat I fink bout it, you shoulda worn brown pants.**

*"Why? Are the monsters afraid of those pants?"* - queried Amir, fixated on any unknown beyond his line of sight.

**Nah...** - answered the Tiger, an evil sort of cheeky smirk appeared on his feline face - **But it can hide quite well any accident if you get too scared.**

*"Huh?"* - it was virtually impossible for Amir to understand the Tiger. His digestive system was used to processing plasma, which is extremely convenient at times.

**Fur now, calm your imagination down** - said the Tiger as he walked straight into the darkness without Amir noticing - **Da worse fings you imagine, da worse it will be.**

*"Thanks for giving me more ideas"* - replied Amir whilst trying to find the Tiger. He turned to the last known location of the fading voice of the Tiger, the spirit had disappeared into the thick black fog - *"Mr Tiger???"*

The silence greeted Amir with indifference, it knew it couldn't reply, otherwise it had to deal with paradoxical consequences.

Amir stood right in the middle of the darkness, or perhaps he was at three quarters of it, he wouldn't know.

*"Hello?"* - he checked again. Somehow, being in this visually deprived environment exalted some of his other senses, like the sense of hearing told him there was absolute silence.

*"I just want to say, I AM NOT AFRAID, Ok?"* - yelling part of the sentence made him feel someone was going to listen to it, it was reassuring, or it was reassuring until he remembered he doesn't know what is lurking in the shadows - *"Not afraid! Not at all... so, if Mister Monster-who-might-jump-out-of-nowhere-and-rip-my-head-off tries to do anything I can tell you: I am very prepared because Mr Tiger warned me! Ok?!?"*

Amir was glad it was this dark, at least he couldn't see his hands shaking. He spun around in an attempt to find the reflective amber eyes of the Tiger - *"Mr Tiger? I feel my courage would be tested a lot better if you stand next to me! You know... for observational purposes!"*

The Tiger didn't reply.

Amir awaited to horrible creatures to pounce out of the darkness with razor sharp teeth and a split tongues spilling acid, but nothing jumped out, nothing attacked him. Standing there, in the middle, or maybe at three quarters, of nowhere was the most difficult part.

Amir didn't like spending that much time with his own thoughts.

He crouched in an attempt to find anything that might burn, anything solid which aren't grains of sand. Everything slipped through his fingers.

Amir grabbed a handful of sand again and again - *That's odd* - he thought. The sand was extremely soft, almost as soft as the air around him. He squeezed some more sand, letting it filter through his fingers and noticed the almost imperceptible sound of the grains rubbing against each other. His hearing had become so acute, he could hear the sand crunching as the weight of each grain pressed the ones below.

The crunching had some rhythm too, almost as if someone was walking towards him. Amir stood up alert to the stranger approaching. Now that he knew the direction of the sound, he could make up a little glimmer fighting to emerge from within the shadows. The glimmer rested on the chest of someone about his height, perhaps a little bit shorter, it was hard to judge sizes when you are unsure of the distance in a really dark room.

*"Hello?"* - he inquired, but the stranger didn't move.

Amir waited a moment or two. Unfortunately for him, patience wasn't his forte and contrary to good judgement, he decided to get closer to the glimmer.

It didn't take long before he could make the contour of the figure, it resembled a statue sculpted out of sand, though there was a ghastly faint glow added to it.

*"Hello?"* - he asked, hoping for someone, even the Tiger, to answer his salute.

*"Amir?"* - asked a female voice; Amir recognised it almost immediately - *"Is that you?"*

*"Hannah?"* - Amir felt confused at the apparition.

Every step Amir took to get closer to the statue revealed intricate features on it. It was Hannah, her face was covered by several deep cracks and parts of her skin decomposed into granules that fell onto the ground.

Hannah's statue embraced herself. There he saw her arms covered in scars - *"You didn't protect me"* - she said.

*"W...what happened?"* - asked Amir, unsure of what was going on.

*"I lost my light"* - she answered - *"because you failed on the one task you had. You had to protect me and you didn't do it."*

Amir felt his heart sinking. An invisible force squeezed it to the point it was about to burst open - *"I..."* - he choked as someone who has lost the air in his lungs.

*"I had to fight the spider on my own"* - she said.

*"But it wasn't my fault!"* - refuted Amir - *"I was blind and mangled! I couldn't do anything towards the end!"*

*"You should've tried, but you didn't"* - accused Hannah - *"I can't rely on you"*

Amir's mind spiralled down out of control, each word carved a deeper gash on his poor and beaten flame.

*"You even tried to pushed us down, we almost dropped to the abyss"*

*"I didn't mean it"* - he said.

*"It doesn't matter if you meant it or not. You can't expect me to put my life on your hands and trust everything will be fine"* - she said - *"You have no idea how to take care of yourself much less others!"*

The downhearted Amir felt empty and disappointed. Hannah's words felt like knives aimed at the most painful areas of his flame. He wanted to argue back each of her accusations, but Hannah was right. How could he refute her words when he failed to take care of her or Sam?

Amir felt desolated, he wasn't the kind of guy to shed a tear, but perhaps the Tiger had begun chopping some onions and he fell victim of the fumes - *"Please stop."*

*"A complete failure"* - added Hannah - *"You are a failure!"*

Amir fell on the ground almost as if his spine had been removed. His fingers buried themselves deep on the soft sand - *"Please, stop."*

*"I can think clearly now"* - followed Hannah - *"I was so stupid, how could someone like me ever liked a guy like you?"*

If the children of the light had hearts, right at this moment, a heart would have ripped itself apart, split in half. The pain was so intense that it filled Amir's chest, it felt as if darkness had appeared in it and consumed everything in it, every single ray of light his little flame produced. It was a void sucking every one of his senses leaving just desperation, followed by hopelessness, like a monster crewing his guts, slowing dragging whatever was left onto a different dimension.

Amir closed his eyes, his hands had disappeared into the wispy powder - *Why is she doing this?* - he thought - *Where is the loving girl that holds me as if she wanted to never let me go?* - a gentle wave of sand granules danced and expanded outwards from his hands.

*"What a disappointment you are"* - said the crumbling Hannah.

The words reached Amir, it had the same effect as the last droplet of rain landing on a dam at its absolute limit; in this case, it was one drop too much. Amir shed one fat tear which ran from the edge of his eyes to the tip of his nose and jumped in free fall towards the powdery ground. There was a ‘poof’ behind Amir, he didn't notice it, he had shutdown once more.

Two delicate arms enclosed Amir, as if she wanted to cover a precious treasure.

He wasn't expecting it and pushed himself away before realising what just happened; far and quick enough to see two statues of Hannah standing next to each other.

This one had her hair decorated with long strands of periwinkle flowers intertwined in a single long braid up to hear waist, she had a long sleeveless dress that gracefully covered her legs up to her ankles. Her skin was flawless. Her face adorned with compassion.

Standing next to that Hannah, a scarred rendition with ragged clothes pointed at Amir - *"I wish you would disappear..."*

*"That's enough!"* - replied Amir without losing sight of the new Hannah - *"You can't be real! My Hannah would never say such horrible things to anybody!"*

The scarred Hannah limped towards Amir and her accusatory hand filled with anger, ready to slap him.

He didn't move, his eyes had found in return loving comfort in the smile of the delicate new Hannah.

*"I... I see"* - replied the scarred Hannah. A large fragment of her face cracked and disintegrated into a stream of dust falling onto the ground. It was like an avalanche which began with a small ball rolling down, hitting an ice sheet that was too unstable, needing just a tiny push to slide down - *"**Your** Hannah wouldn't, right?"* - said the now unrecognisable shape that collapsed onto a mound of fine powder.

Amir extended his hand; it was greeted by the smooth arms of Hannah who pulled him up. 

*"Tiger! I know it was you!"* - voiced Amir as loud as he could without yelling - *"I won't fall for any of your tricks with that thing!"*

**Dat fing?** - at the distance, a pair of large amber eyes flared up. Red streaks of burning embers highlighted the rest of the silhouette of a feline ancestry - **I'm not dat fing, boy. Dats all you! It was your doing!**

*"How could that thing be my doing?"* - Amir snapped back.

The amber pupils pierced through the darkness -  **I don't have dat kind of power, I just take people into deir brains and deir fear bends dem down.**

Behind Amir a ‘Sssh’ sound filled the otherwise quiet background of the featureless scenery submerged in shadows. Amir sought the origin of the sound, he found the mound of sand has turned into a new shape. Deep grooves covered the body of the new creature. Solid chunks bubbled from its chest and moved towards its face composing the countenance of Sam.

*"Hi..."* - said monotonally the newcomer to Amir - "buddy!"

*"Sam?"* - Amir's flame skipped a beat - *"It can't be you."*

*"Oh wow... What kind of friend doubts his best friend?"* - added a twisted rendition of Sam - *"Perhaps we never were such good friends."*

*"No! We were!"* - desperately replied Amir.

*"You said it buddy... **We were**"* - as Sam said the last words it collapsed into a cloud of dust. Deeper in the darkness Sam's voice reached with a deafened tone - *«Why did you follow me?»*

*"Followed you where?"* - said Amir.

*«You sneaked on me!» «You stalked me!» «You saw me tumbling down into the portal... » «You saw me walking into the cave» «You saw me talking to the spirit»* - each phrase came from a different location around Amir. Each sounded like Sam, each loaded with resentment.

*"Wha... How did you know I followed you into the portal?"* - Amir struggled to find the direction of the voice. He had wrapped his arms around Hannah, as a frightened child holding a teddy bear before the big scary monster crawls out of the closet, not that Amir knew what a bear is; or teddy; or a closet as the matter of fact.

*«You snake!» «FAKE! FAKE! FAKE!» «A bad friend» «... treacherous!» «a false friend» «Liar!»* - multiple voices streamed at the same time towards Amir's sore ears. He felt trapped in the darkness.

Ghastly silhouettes began to show their contours surrounding the pair. Amir tried to push his rendition of Hannah behind him, but a copy of Sam stretched an arm and ripped a substantial portion of Hannah. Her statue began to disintegrate to Amir's horror.

*Think of a wall, a barrier of sorts! Think of anything to stop them!* - thought Amir to himself.

**Tricky biz finking on da spot, uh?** - commented the Tiger watching from afar.

*«Bad friend!»*

*"Help me!"* - screamed Amir in desperation, pleading to the large blazing striped animal spirit - *"Please!"*

**Wid wut?** - said the enormous fire feline of three to four children tall - **I'm sorry boy, dose fings look kinda creepy and I don't wanna get in da middle of your imagination... Hey! wut're you doin!?**

*«You leech!»*

Amir saw that the Tiger flared up and rolled on the ground leaving scorched statues of Sam behind, bubbling on the spot. Amir would have enjoyed the show but several arms grabbed him and pushed him against the ground. It was clear to Amir his assailants were attacking the Tiger at the same time.

**Boy! Get your fears in check!** - said the feline jumping and bursting in flames, charring as many attackers clinging to it as possible.

*«LIAR»*

Amir narrowly avoided a hook punch from Sam#42 - *"I try! But these keep coming straight at my face!"*

The Tiger roared loudly in pain. Sam#77 dug its twisted fingers into his snout - **Try damn harder!**

Amir checked once more the state of his projection of Hannah, the fighting wasn't doing her any good. Every new Sam approaching her was met with Amir's foot.

*«You left on the first chance you had.»*

Another three Sams appeared from the shadows holding his shoulders, pushing his chest to the ground. In the struggle, Amir let go the last fragments of Hannah's hand before she vanished in a poof.

*«You can never be like me»*

*"I KNOW!"* - yelled Amir. He eyes closed shut, his lips covered with the fine dust - *"I know I can't be like you. You are clever. You take your time to solve things... and I... I am just a brute!"*

As the last word lingered in the air, the horde of Sams crumbled away in an esoteric chain reaction. Each new attacker ceased to exist like a jigsaw puzzle falling of the table, meeting an abrupt end. Amir felt some of the weight lightening up; most of the aggressors had retreated to a different realm, with the exception of one, it remained pulling Amir's arm whilst its knee buried deeper on his back.

*"Sam, please, stop!"* - said Amir containing the strain of his shoulder - *"Let's talk it out."*

*«What is it you want to talk?»* - heard Amir in a voice that was somewhat familiar and unpleasant. The aggressor recognised the baffled expression on Amir's face - *«That's right. Nobody likes to hear their own voice, do they?»*

A flash of red and yellow light removed the twisted assailant off Amir's back - **You alrite boy?**

*"Yes... thanks"* - replied Amir wavering if he should ask or let things the way they are - *"Why are you helping me?"*

**Cuz dats very messed up** - replied the Tiger above Amir. From this point of view, Amir felt so small, partially due to the fact the spirit was several times his size, but most importantly because... well, everything makes you feel small when the everything's paw is about your size - **In all my years I've seen all kinds of fears. Dis is da first time I see anybody fearing demselves.**

The twisted, partially burnt lump began moving, picking itself up and placing three large fragments on its face. Amir's gut felt empty when he recognised his face.

*«See? You can't do anything on your own»* - the twisted Amir took a few trial steps closer to Amir - *«Admit it, you know you will fail now because you can't do anything on your own. Sam and Hannah won't leave you and they too will be condemned. You are a useless little clown.»*

The Tiger's gaze switched between one Amir to the other. The Amir under him seemed to ponder the suggestions of the twisted one - **Oi, you ok?**

*"I can't fail"* - Amir had decided he can't sit without giving a fight - *"I won't let them down."*

**Dats a fought** - said the Tiger.

*"Fought as in fight?"* - queried Amir getting a little bit confused.

**No... fought as in I have foughts, you have foughts. Like I am finking.** - clarified the Tiger. The thought reached the inner insecurities of the Tiger - **Oi! Are you making fun of me?**

*«Are you going to buddy up with this creature as well? Will you leech his life too?»*

**Ah, jokes onya** - replied the Tiger - **I'm passed my perspiration date.**

*"I don't think he meant that..."* - reflected Amir, getting used to translate Tigerish to a language he could understand.

The Tiger looked up, it was the typical gesture of ‘searching in my personal memory database’ as he remembered the last few events - **Oh, wait... I get it.**

*«You do not have the strength to fight me»*

*"Maybe, but I'll try."* - replied Amir with conviction.

«You are too indecisive»

*"I am not!"* - He added - *"Or maybe I am. No! Definitely no! Maybe?"*

*«You are a coward»*

*"Not a coward... I just think that others might have better arguments to discuss when a hungry ugly monster shows up"* - added Amir, giving an apologetic look at the Tiger - *"No offence intended."*

**Wid wut?** - replied the Tiger.

*«You've lied to your friends»*

*"Nah-uh. I just didn't tell the truth to Sam. I didn't want him to think I was a stalker that was starstruck when he showed up"*

The two previous phrases finally clicked on the Tiger's brain - **Hey! I ain't a monster!**

*«The path ahead will be harsh. When the time comes, would you choose their lives or yours?»*

Amir remembered past opportunities in which he wanted to be useful to Sam and Hannah, he wasn't the type who would think things through. He remembered watching the stars whilst sitting in front of the gate on that lonesome island. He was petrified of the path ahead of him. He remembered following Sam without a single doubt in his mind - *"Mister Tiger. I don't think I got what it takes..."*

The twisted Amir began smiling - *«Yes, you are not capable»*

*"And more often than not, I screw it up..."*

*«A complete mess»*

*"And I don't know if I vanquish all my fears..."*

*«You are not strong enough to fight it»*

*"But I've come this far due to the love I have for my friends and their support"*

*«No...»*

*"If I were alone, I would definitely say I would choose my own life to risk it for someone else."*

*«No!...»*

*"I want to see things through. I want to be with my friends!"*

*«NO!»*

*"Is that answer, ok?"*

**All you need to do is kick dis fing's bottom real hard. Fink about da moments you want to share wid your friends.**

Amir closed his eyes, imagined the worried look on Hannah and Sam's anxiety - *They are waiting for me...*

Amir clenched his fists, the sand around him began to shake and dance around him.

*«What are you doing?»*

A large mound of sand began bulging, it took a round shape with an inverted star pattern grooved in it, like a starfish stretching on a gym ball.

*«Stop it!!!»*

The originally amorphous shape restructured itself into a large crouching-person-like creature. It was as tall as the already gigantic animal shape of the Tiger.

**Wow, Dat's cool! I've never seen a golem before.**

The twisted Amir raised his hands. A horde of Sams and Hannahs appeared from the shadows, running straight at the golem whilst Amir climbed on the golem's hand.

The golem moved its feet, launching up into the air countless members of the horde. Amir moved his hand commanding the golem to capture the other Amir. The golem followed his orders, grabbing the twisted Amir effortlessly whist keeping the horde of copies far away.

*«So you have decided to squash me like a bug? I have news for you, I'll come back!»*

Amir jumped onto the other hand of the golem and hugged his twisted version - *"Right now I can't win against you. I just have to accept you live within me."*

*«Ah, bastard... I wanted a fight.»* - Poof! The horde of clones vanished in a cloud of dust.

The golem checked its hand, surveying the location of its target. It had disappeared.

**Dat was very enteritis... enterprise? Nah dat wasn't it either... I mean, it was dope.**

They stood there in silence. Amir shook his robe a few times to get rid of the excess of sand. The Tiger stood erect as straight as possible, he wanted to see if he was taller than the golem.

Amir waited a few seconds, expecting anything to happen. He hoped a burst of light would reveal the blessing he was looking for, instead he watched the Tiger stand on its hind legs in an attempt to surpass the golem's height - *"... So, what now?"*

**Well boy, I didn't want to tell you, but courage is not somefing I can give out. You must find it in you, you see?**

*"Oh, I see"* - said Amir feeling somewhat disappointed - *"I guess, I've failed this trial."*

**Dat would be da logical concussion if you don't have da little lite.**

Amir checked his empty hands, it had bruises and it was all covered in dust, but there was no sign of the light - *"Mister Tiger, could I ask a favour of you?"*

**Wut is it?**

*"Could you hug Sam and Hannah and tell them I am sorry?"*

The Tiger nodded.

Amir looked down as the golem slowly became undone, losing its sand to the ground, fading from view into the ground.

**Oi boy, I fink you have a little bit of dust rite here** - said the Tiger, blowing at Amir's chest. The white flame on his chest flickered brightly, holding on for dear life to its owner. It flicked twice and it began to glow red - **Yeh, dats much better.**

*"What happened? Why is it doing this?"*

**So you can go and hug your friend yourself.**

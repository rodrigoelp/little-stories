# Ignition

The flames roared around Amir, clouding his view from anything around him.

*"Mister, are you still there?"* - Amir clenched his fingers hoping the pressure would tell him if he still had a firm grip on the Tiger.

**Just a moment. We are 'bout to get der** - Amir registered the voice from inside his skull.

The bright light kept Amir completely disoriented. He didn't know if they were travelling, standing or what. He only knew his body was squeezed through a narrow passage of bright red and orange light.

**Oh... one sec...** - said the Tiger.

The flames around Amir shone brighter than before, streaks of yellow painted bizarre lines ahead of him. Amir rose his free hand, or he thought he did, he couldn't see anything other than the intense light blinding him. The flames surrounding him overwhelmed his senses.

*"How come the flames aren't burning me?"* - asked Amir.

**Huh?** - said the Tiger as Amir broke his concentration - **Flames do not burn da children of da lite... Where was I? Oh yeh, dis way...**

Amir had noticed the raging flames acquired a degree of tranquility when he Tiger replied one of his questions. Amir couldn't figure out if he was holding the Tiger's hand - *Was I holding with my right or with my left?* - The bright orange light changed slowly to deep reds.

*"Yellow and red goes really well together, huh?"* - asked Amir.

The raging flames calmed down - **Wut?**

*"I said I liked the red and yellow colours."* - explained Amir - *"If I could I would wear those colours, so when I fly past some people they would"*

**Too much information** - interrupted the Tiger. There was a hint of annoyance in his voice - **Gimme sum silence, please.**

The chaotic movement of plasma returned to its active state, or so noticed Amir. He wanted to stay silence, but what can an hyperactive boy do when all there is to do is to watch flames go by? Normally, Amir would have felt the passage of time as if every single second had been stretched into minutes, but waiting in silence made each second feel like it took decades.

*"I'm here... waiting..."* - said Amir.

**Wait! I missed it again?** - said the Tiger to himself.

*"... quiet. In total and utter stillness of the silence of the night, day, midday?"* - continued Amir.

The passing flames slowed down significantly, almost frozen in place - **I MISSED DA DAMNED EXIT AGAIN!**

*"What?"*

**Boy, be quiet!**

*"What happened?"*

**I need to... concatenate here!**

*"You mean, concentrate?"*

**Shuddap! You'll make me crash!**

*"I just wanted to know where are you taking me?"*

**... to da inner parts of your brain.** - the Tiger struggled to keep calm but he was too annoyed at the constant squabbling - **You know, in your head.**

Amir felt the tone of the answer had the subliminal message of ‘ask me one more thing and I will leave you to the side of this road’, so he fought his inner thoughts and tried to remain soundless.

The flames raged on, but the composition of the flames changed slowly from the warm palette of reds and yellows to streaks of blue and pinks.

**Finally! I found da spot!** - said the Tiger filled with solace.

*"Which spot?"* - asked Amir.

**Where you hide your biggest fears!** - answered the Tiger, instants before Amir's field of view became clear of the wall of fire.



Amir rode the tiger all the way down to the ground, they can't see much farther than a few feet away from them. Even the flames of the Tiger seemed to be getting choked by the nothingness around them. There the tiger tells him, this is the place he never wanted to be left alone, but it is the only way to test if he has what it is needed to continue with his friends.

Amir asks if there are horrible monsters awaiting for him.

The Tiger answers that it is so much worse and wishes him good luck. The Tiger turns back into his animal shape, disappearing into the thick black fog.

Amir tries to look around yelling "I am not afraid of any of this... Mr monster who might jump out of nowhere and bite my head off."

But nothing jumped out of the dark room to attack him.

Amir tried to search around, in an attempt to find something to burn, but the fine sand on the floor slips through his fingers, it is extremely soft, almost as soft as the air. Amir notices a glimmer and he walks towards it. The glimmer seems to be someone about his height, perhaps a little bit shorter.

He runs towards the figure, The figure looks like a statue made out of the sand on the ground, but it had a faint glow.

"Hello?" - he asked, hoping for someone, even the Tiger, so answer his enquiry.

"Amir?" - asked a female voice; Amir recognised it almost immediately - "Is that you?"

"Hannah? Where are you?"

The statue slowly revealed its face to Amir. It was a statue of Hannah, her face was covered by large crack and granules fell onto the ground - *"You didn't protect me"*

*"W...what happened?"* - asked Amir, unsure of what was going on.

*"I lost my light"* - she answered - *"because you failed on the one task you had. You had to protect me and you didn't do it."*

Amir felt his heart sinking. An invisible force squeezed it to the point it was about to burst open - "I..."

*"I had to fight the spider on my own"* - she said.

"But it wasn't my fault!" - refuted Amir - "I couldn't do anything towards the end!"

"I can't rely on you" - continued Hannah.

Amir felt spiralling down out of control, each word carved a deeper gash on his poor and beaten flame.

"You pushed us down, we almost dropped to the abyss"

"I didn't mean it" - he said.

"It doesn't matter if you meant it or not. You can't expect me to put my flame on your hands and trust everything will be fine. You have no idea how to take care of yourself much less others!" - she said.

The downhearted Amir felt empty and disappointed. He wanted to argue back each of the points, but Hannah was right. He had now idea how to look after himself. He had shown several times he couldn't take care of her nor Sam. Amir wasn't the sort of people who would cry when feeling desolated, but perhaps the Tiger had begun chopping some onions and he had received the fumes - "Please stop."

"You are a failure" - added Hannah.

Amir fell on the ground almost as if his spine had been removed. His fingers buried themselves deep on the soft sand - "Please, stop."

"I can think clearly now" - followed Hannah - "I have never liked you."

If the children of the light had hearts, right at this moment, a heart would have exploded, split in half. An intense pain filled Amir's chest, it felt as if darkness had appeared in it and began consuming every single ray of light his little flame produced. The void consumed his senses leaving behind desperation, followed by hopelessness, like a monster crewing his guts, slowing dragging everything onto a different dimension.

Amir closed his eyes, his hands had disappeared into the wispy power - *Why is she doing this?* - he thought - *Where is the loving one that holds me as if she wanted to never let me go?* - a gentle wave of sand granules danced and expanded outwards from his hands.

*"What a disappointment you are"* - said the crumbling Hannah.

The words reached Amir, it had the same effect as the last droplet of rain landing on a dam about to break; in this case, it was one drop too much. Amir shed one fat tear which travelled from his eyes to the tip of his nose and jumped in free fall towards the powdery ground. There was a ‘poof’ behind Amir, he didn't notice it, he had shutdown once more.

Two delicate arms enclosed Amir, as if she wanted to cover a precious treasure. In his surprise, he pushed himself away before he realised what just happened; far enough to notice another statue of Hannah. This one had her hair decorated with long strands of periwinkle flowers intertwined in a single long braid up to hear waist, she had a long sleeveless dress covering her legs.

*"I wish you would disappear..."* - continued the old Hannah.

*"That's enough!"* - replied Amir without losing sight of the new Hannah - *"My Hannah would never say such horrible things."*

The old Hannah walked towards Amir and raised her hand in anger to slap him. He didn't move, his eyes had found in return loving comfort in the smile of the delicate new Hannah.

*"I... I see"* - replied the old Hannah. A large fragment of her face cracked and disintegrated into a stream of dust falling onto the ground. It was like an avalanche which began with a small ball rolling down, hitting an ice sheet that was too unstable, needing just a tiny push to slide down - *"**Your** Hannah wouldn't, right?"* - the unrecognisable shape collapsed onto a mound of fine powder.

Amir extended his hand; it was greeted by the smooth replica go Hannah who pulled him up. 

*"Stop hiding Tiger!"* - voiced Amir as loud as he could without yelling - *"I know you were that thing."*

At the distance, a pair of large yellow eyes flared up. Red streaks of burning embers highlighted the rest of the silhouette of a feline ancestry - **Dat fing? I'm not dat fing, boy. Dats all you! I don't have dat kind of power, I just take people into deir brains and deir fear bends dem down.**

*"That wasn't me!"* - Amir snapped back - *"It was that thing!"*

Behind Amir a ‘Sssh’ sound filled the otherwise quiet background of the featureless scenery. Amir sought the origin of the sound, unfortunately he found the mound of sand has turned into a new shape. Deep grooves covered the body of the new creature. Solid chunks bubbled from its chest and moved towards its face composing the countenance of Sam.

*"Hey buddy"* - said monotonally the newcomer to Amir.

*"Sam?"* - Amir's flame skipped a beat - *"It can't be you."*

*"Oh wow... What kind of friend doubts about his best friend?"* - added the scarred Sam - *"Perhaps we were never such good friends."*

*"No! We were!"* - desperately replied Amir.

*"You said it buddy... **We were**"* - as Sam said the last words it collapsed into a cloud of dust. Deeper in the darkness Sam's voice reached with a deafened tone - *«Why did you follow me?»*

*"Followed you where?"* - said Amir.

*«You sneaked on me! - You saw me tumbling down into the portal... - You saw me walking into the cave - You saw me talking to the spirit»* - each phrase came from a different location around Amir. Each sounded like Sam, each loaded with resentment.

*"Wha... How did you know I followed you into the portal?"* - Amir struggled to find the direction of the voice. He had wrapped his arms around Hannah, as a frightened child would hold a teddy bear before the big scary monster comes from under the bed, not that Amir knew what a bear is; or teddy as the matter of fact.

*«You are a snake - FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! - a bad friend - treacherous! - a false friend - Liar!»* - multiple voices streamed at the same time towards Amir's sore ears. He felt trapped in the darkness.

Ghastly silhouettes began to show their contours surrounding the pair. Amir tried to push his rendition of Hannah behind him, but a copy of Sam stretched an arm and ripped a substantial portion of Hannah. Her statue began to disintegrate to Amir's horror.

*Think of a wall, think of anything to stop them!* - thought Amir to himself.

**Tricky biz finking on da spot, uh?** - commented the Tiger watching from afar.

*«Bad friend!»*

*"Help me!"* - screamed Amir in desperation, pleading to the large blazing striped animal spirit - *"Please!"*

**Wid wut?** - said the enormous fire feline of three to four children tall - **I'm sorry boy, dose fings look kinda creepy and I don't wanna get in da middle of your imagination... Hey! wut're you doin!?**

*«You leech!»*

Amir saw that the Tiger had begun contouring and rolling on the ground leaving flattened scorched Sam statues behind, bubbling on the spot. Amir thought about it in between arms trying to pin him down, that a group of Sams found the presence of the Tiger and decided to attack it.

**Boy! Get your fears in check!** - said the feline jumping and bursting in flames, burning as many statues clinging to it as possible.

*«LIAR»*

Amir narrowly avoided a hook punch from Sam#42 - *"I try! But these keep coming straight at my face!"*

The Tiger made a loud roar in pain as he tried to remove Sam#77 digging its twisted fingers into his snout - **Try harder!**

Amir checked once more the state of his projection of Hannah, the fighting wasn't doing her any good. Every new Sam approaching her was met with Amir's foot.

*«You left on the first opportunity.»*

Another three Sams appeared from the shadows holding his shoulders, pushing his chest to the ground. In the struggle, Amir let go the last fragments of Hannah before she vanished in a poof.

*«You can never be like me»*

*"I KNOW!"* - yelled Amir. He eyes closed shut, his lips covered with the fine dust - *"I know I can't be like you. You are clever, you take your time to solve things... I am just a brute!"*

As the last word lingered in the air, the horde of Sams crumbled away in an esoteric chain reaction. Each new attacker ceased to exist like a jigsaw puzzle falling of the table. Amir felt some of the weight lightening up; most of the aggressors had retreated to a different realm, with the exception of one, it remained pulling Amir's arm whilst its knee buried deeper on his back.

*"Sam, please, stop!"* - said Amir containing the strain of his shoulder - *"We can talk it out."*

*«What is it you want to talk?»* - heard Amir in a voice that was somewhat familiar and unpleasant. The aggressor recognised the baffled expression on Amir's face - *«That's right. Nobody likes to hear their own voice.»*

A flash of red and yellow light removed the twisted assailant off Amir's back - **You alrite boy?**

*"Yes... thanks"* - replied Amir wavering if he should ask or let things the way they are - *"Why are you helping me?"*

**Cuz dats very messed up** - replied the Tiger above Amir. From this point of view, Amir felt so small, partially due to the fact the spirit was several times his size, but most importantly because... well, everything makes you feel small when the everything's paw is about your size - **In all my years I've seen all kinds of fears. Dis is da first time I see anybody fearing demselves.**

The twisted, partially burnt lump began moving, picking itself up and placing three large fragments on its face. Amir's gut felt empty when he recognised his face.

*«See? You can't do anything on your own»* - the twisted Amir took a few trial steps closer to Amir - *«Admit it, you know you will fail now. Sam and Hannah won't leave you and they too will be condemned, because you are a useless little clown»*

The Tiger's gaze switched between one Amir to the other. The Amir under him seemed to ponder the suggestions of the twisted one - **Oi, you ok?**

*"I can't fail"* - Amir had decided he can't sit without giving a fight - *"I won't let them down."*

**Dats a fought** - said the Tiger.

*"Fought as in fight?"* - queried Amir getting a little bit confused.

**No... fought as in I have foughts. Like I am finking.** - clarified the Tiger - **Are you making fun of me?**

*«Are you going to buddy up with this creature as well? Will you leech his life too?»*

**Ah, jokes onya** - replied the Tiger - **I'm already dead.**

*"I don't think he meant that..."* - added Amir.

The Tiger looked up, remembering the last few events - **Oh... I get it.**

*«You do not have the straight to fight me»*

*"I'll try"*

*«You are a coward»*

*"Not a coward... I just think that others might have better arguments to discuss when a hungry monster shows up"* - added Amir, giving an apologetic look at the Tiger - *"No offence intended."*

**Wid wut?** - replied the Tiger.

*«You've lied to your friends»*

*"Nah-uh. I just didn't tell the truth to Sam. I didn't want him to think I was a stalker that was starstruck when he showed up"*

Previous phrases finally clicked on the Tiger's brain - **Hey! I ain't a monster!**

*«The path ahead will be harsh. When the time comes, would you choose their lives or yours?»*

Amir remembered the previous opportunities in which he wanted to be useful to Sam and Hannah, he wasn't the type who would think things through. He remembered watching the stars whilst sitting in front of the gate on that lonesome island. He was petrified of the path ahead of him. He remembered following Sam without a single doubt in his mind - *"Mister Tiger. I don't know if I got what it takes..."*

The twisted Amir began smiling - *«Yes, you are not capable»*

*"And more often than not, I screw it up..."*

*«A complete mess»*

*"And I don't know if I vanquish all my fears..."*

*«You are not strong enough»*

*"But I've come this far due to the love I have for my friends and their support"*

*«No...»*

*"If I were alone, I would definitely say I would choose my own life to risk it for someone else."*

*«No!...»*

*"I want to see things through. I want to be with my friends!"*

*«NO!»*

*"Is that answer, ok?"*

**All you need to do is kick dis fing's bottom real hard. Fink about da moments you want to share wid your friends.**

Amir closed his eyes, imagined the worried look on Hannah and Sam's anxiety - *They are waiting for me...*

Amir clenched his fists, the sand around him began to shake.

*«What are you doing?»*

A large mound of sand began bulging, it took a round shape with an inverted star pattern grooved in it.

*«Stop it!!!»*

The originally amorphous shape restructured itself into a large crouching-person-like creature. It was as tall as the already gigantic animal shape of the Tiger.

**Wow, Dat's cool! I've never seen a golem before.**

The twisted Amir raised his hands. A horde of Sams and Hannahs appeared from the shadows, running straight at the golem whilst Amir climbed on the golem's hand.

The golem moved its feet, launching up in the air countless members of the horde. Amir moved his hand commanding the golem to capture the other Amir. The golem followed his orders, grabbing the twisted Amir effortlessly whist keeping the horde of copies far away.

*«So you have decided to squash me like a bug? I have news for you, I'll come back!»*

Amir jumped onto the other hand of the golem and hugged his twisted version - *"Right now I can't win against you. I just have to accept you live with me."*

*«Ah, bastard... I wanted a fight.»* - Poof! The horde of clones vanished in a cloud of dust.

The golem checked its hand, surveying the location of its target. It had disappeared.

**Dat was very enteritis... enterprise? Nah dat wasn't it either... It was dope.**

They stood there in silence. Amir shook his robe a few times to get rid of the excess of sand. The Tiger stood erect as straight as possible, he wanted to see if he was taller than the golem.

*"... So, what now?"*

**Well boy, I didn't want to tell you, but courage is not somefing I can give out. You must find it in you, you see?**

*"Oh, I see"* - said Amir feeling somewhat disappointed - *"I guess, I've failed this trial."*

**Dat would be the logical concussion if you don't have da lite.**

*"Mister Tiger, could I ask a favour of you?"*

**Wut is it?**

*"Could you hug Sam and Hannah and tell them I am sorry?"*

The Tiger nodded. Amir looked down, the golem slowly began losing its sand to the ground, fading from view.

**Oi boy, I fink you have a little bit of dust right here** - said the Tiger, blowing at Amir's chest. The white flame on his chest flickered brightly, holding on for dear life to its owner. It flicked twice and began glowing red - **Yeh, dats much better.**

*"What happened? Why is it doing this?"*

**Now you can hug your friend yourself.**

# The guide

Father elder was sitting watching out the gate of truth. Its glow and threats of light extended far into this space the elders reside in. He looked down at sparks coming from his staff, giving him a sight from beyond and he slowly stood up.

*What kind of afterlife is this that even here my flame aches?* - thought the old elder. His sight went back to the gate, a dark-robed figure stood by the gate.

*"Hi, old friend! It's been a while since the last time I spoke with you... the child has arrived and last time I checked, he seems to have jumped right into action!"* - said Father. The dark-robed figured nodded. *"Anyways, I summoned you as you know, to look after the kid. I think he will become a fine guide."*

The dark figure nodded once more, turned around and walked into the gate. *"I know he is a... creature of few words but I was expecting a boomy ‘hello, how are you? I am fine thanks’..."* - said Father.

*"Father? Are you alright?"* - asked the Smith. *"You have been talking to yourself for a while now and we need you with the new wave of children waking up now."*

*"Yes, yes... I was just saying hi to an old friend."* - replied father dismissively of any concerned displayed by the Smith.

Father start to walk back to his favourite resting spot, holding tight to his staff... *"Oh no!"* said raising his hands in the same action a grandparent remembers they placed the teapot to boil water about 6 hours ago.

*"What?"* - replied the Smith.

*"I forgot to say the catchy phrase to the kid. I wanted to wake him up by saying **‘Wake up, child! Bring our lost stars home!’**"* - said Father with anguish - *"Some how, when I say it, it has less oomph than..."*

*"(Sigh)... <sub>nobody remembers that phrase ever</sub> "* - mumbled the Smith

*"What?"* - said Father

*"There will be a next time to see the awe in their face. Something that ‘stays with them forever’..."* - replied the Smith. Walking the old spirit back to their contemplation spot.

Father sat, watching the gate with the Smith standing next to him - *"... So beautiful... By the way my darling, I think you are spending a tad much time with the Twins. I may be old, but I am not deaf"*

A cold drop of sweat ran down the Smith's neck.

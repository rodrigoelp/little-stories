# The guide

acrimonious if you didn't pray daily and didn't doubt its word.

In this universe, the afterlife was a bit more pragmatic. The spirit of those who have passed away reunited with their loved ones, and in some cases, just acquaintances awaiting an explanation to the most important question in their intangible minds: How come you were holding an incredibly heavy flower pot at the same time I walked under your balcony? and how come you had a second one that also landed on my head?

This afterlife has a peaceful beauty, most of the spirits floated around like shooting stars, glowing their path as they went through. Some of the spirits, the Elders, took a more corporeal appearance suitable for good storytelling.

In their previous lives, the Elders guided their children to explore new lands, grow strong and content. However, the afterlife changed slightly their roles, they were responsible for relocating spirits, finding new heroes, making rain top stop a particularly ugly kid from naked dances around burning sticks, receiving those who have laid their flame for a good cause and giving them a chance to stay with them as stars or send them back to the land of the living.

Out of all the elders, Father conducted the orchestra, musically speaking.

His hands reshaped the fabric of spacetime and the stars answered his request. He asked for a bench from which to observe the passage of time, regardless of its direction, and the rest of the elders made an observation post overlooking the entire afterlife and beyond. This post because his permanent resting place.

On this particular day... erm, moment in time, Father sat watching out the gate of truth, his mind lost in million possibilities for the current line of events. The gate of truth  glowed and extended threads of light far into this space the elders reside in. He looked down at sparks coming from his staff, each spark was a window to a different spacetime continuum, visions of the past and the future.

A crackling noise came from his staff bringing him into the present. Grabbing tightly his staff, he proceeds to standup gradually as each bone made a snap for every muscle trying to tense up - *What kind of afterlife is this that even here my flame aches?* - thought the old elder. His gaze returning to the bright spot which was the gate, a dark-robed figure stood by it.



*"Hi, old friend! It's been a while since the last time I spoke with you... the child has arrived and last time I checked, he seems to have jumped right into action!"* - said Father. The dark-robed figured nodded. *"Anyways, I summoned you as you know, to look after the kid. I think he will become a fine guide."*

The dark figure nodded once more, turned around and walked into the gate. *"I know he is a... creature of few words but I was expecting a boomy ‘hello, how are you? I am fine thanks’..."* - said Father.



*"Father? Are you alright?"* - asked the Smith. *"You've been talking to yourself for a while now and we need you with the new wave of children waking up."*

*"Yes, yes... I was just saying hi to an old friend."* - replied father dismissively of any concerned displayed by the Smith.



Father walked back to his favourite resting spot, holding tight to his staff... - *"Oh no!"* - said raising his hands in the same action a grandparent remembers they placed the teapot to boil water about 6 hours ago.

*"What?"* - replied the Smith.

*"I forgot to say the catchy phrase to the kid. I wanted to wake him up by saying **‘Wake up, child! Bring our lost stars home!’**"* - said Father with anguish - *"Some how, when I say it, it has less oomph than..."*

*"(Sigh)... <sub>nobody remembers that phrase ever</sub> "* - mumbled the Smith.

*"What?"* - said Father.

*"There will be a next time to see the awe in their face. Something that ‘stays with them forever’..."* - replied the Smith. Walking the old spirit back to their contemplation spot.



Father sat, watching the gate with the Smith standing next to him - *"... So beautiful... By the way my darling, I think you are spending a tad much time with the Twins. I may be old, but I am not deaf."*

A cold drop of sweat ran down the Smith's neck and shivers brought her memories from the past.

# Flaring embers

Amir found himself overwhelmed by the enormous spirit standing a few metres away from him.

Despite the coat the spirit wore, Amir could make up the muscular complexion of the spirit, however paranormal it was, it looked the large side came bundled with big large pectorals. Yet Amir found the gaze of the Tiger the strongest attribute of the spirit. His glowing slitted bright yellow eyes stared at the children in expectation behind the fierce expression of the mask.

**I AM CERTAINLY CONFIDENT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING UNPLEASANT AGITATION!** - said the Tiger.

Amir felt Hannah's hand on his back, she tried to escape from the Tiger's gaze behind Amir - *"Stop it! You are pushing me!"*

*"It is massive!"* - said Hannah with certain tones of apology.

*"Oi!"* - yelled Sam - *"We are not ready!"* - Sam gathered himself close to Amir - *"We are not ready, are we?"*

*"Why are you looking at me?"* - said Amir feeling coerced to talk to the Tiger.

The Tiger remained standing still with the same triumphant pose; each hand rested on his waist and chest fully inflated. If the children would've paid attention, they would have noticed the position was quite awkward and difficult to maintain.

*Pssh! Spidie!* - whispered the Turtle - *What is he holding with his left hand?*

*What?* - replied the Spider and sharped her sight on the object the Tiger had under his grip - *Dic... tio... narium...*

The Spider stopped reading as she felt the deep audible breath - *(Sigh) Tiger, really? A dictionarium manuale!?*

**SSSSH!** - He replied feeling uncomfortable. He signalled with his right a few times. The Spider could have understood this either as ‘I know what I am doing’ or as ‘Spider, please, do not steal my thunder!’

**WHERE ARE DA IN...** - the Tiger deviated a glance back to the book before he continued - **DA INFANTS BOUT TO BE VAULTED?**

The Wolf shook his head - **‘Evaluated**

**YES, BOUT TO BE EVALUATED! SHOW ME DA COURAGE...** - he looked down once more - **TAKING PERMANENT TENANCY IN YOUR....** - another glance to the book - **YOUR CARDIAC PUMP!**

Hannah peeked from behind Amir. Something was very suspicious about this spirit.

Sam scratched his head trying to understand what the spirit tried to say.

Amir was just in state of awe.



*"Tiger, why are you talking like that?"* - enquired the Bat.

The Wolf snuck behind the Tiger and in one swift move, took the book from his hands, holding it out of his reach.

**Hey! Give back da book!** - said the Tiger. The tone of his voice didn't echoed through the entire chamber like it did before.

**No** - replied the Wolf - **Enough of this silly charade!**

*"The Tiger's voice... is... different!"* - asked Sam - *"What is going on?"*

A little smirk began appearing on the Bat's face - *"I think I know what is going on... Is the Tiger's ego crushed because you had a child shaming you because of how you talk?!"*

**MOSS! WHY!?** - squeaked the Tiger, revealing the Bat was spot on.

*Oh dear Tiger* - said the Spider - *You've got to let it go!*

**You do not know how bad it felt! How could you understand when you are da knowledgable spirit!** - complained the Tiger to the Spider.



Time had stopped, if anything momentarily, to allow us examine the thoughts of the children.

Amir had started to notice that, the Tiger was losing some of his ‘cool’ factor.

Hannah imagined Amir's face behind the Tiger's mask. She was sure the attitude matched the persona.

Sam found himself more confused than before.



*So lame* - whispered the Turtle.

**I am NOT lame!** - refuted the Tiger.

*"You girls are bullies!"* - intervened the Bat - *"He wanted to have a good impression, right kitty?"*

**Das rite!** - replied the Tiger.

*"So, don't you bully this kitty cat!"* - said the Bat, the smirk more visible than ever - *"He is pure of ‘cardiac pump’!"*

The Turtle, the Spider and the Bat burst in laugher.

**Hey!** - complained the Tiger.

Sam walked closer to the Wolf - *"Uhum!"* - he cleared his throat, a clear action to muster some guts to ask difficult question as well as dislodging attracting the  attention of those around, which in this case was the Wolf - *"Excuse me, what is happening?"*

The Wolf looked down, Sam's face had certainly changed these past few days - **Even I am not sure** - replied the Wolf, just to raise his voice once more - **Enough! Tiger! State your business!**

**Rite! My business.** - The Tiger leaned over Sam, giving him a careful inspection.

**Pop!** - he said. Two bright sparkling orbs floated above Sam's head; one blue and one lime - **I see... Da Turtle and da Bat gave you deir blessings.** - he added. The Tiger suddenly pushed his face closer to Sam in an attempt to make him flinch.

Sam blinked as the wind rushed through and pushed his face a little further away from the Tiger's decorated mask - *"Uhms... Mr Tiger?"*

**Are you so afraid dat you can't move?** - asked the Tiger.

Sam gave a crooked look back - *"No?"*

**Den, why did ya backed for a sec?** - pressed the Tiger.

*"I don't want to tell..."* - replied Sam awkwardly.

**Say it boy!** - said the Tiger closing on Sam.

*"Your breath..."* - Sam leaned closer to the Tiger's ear and whispered to it - *"It smells pretty bad."*

The Tiger stood up straight self-consciously, cupping his hands over his mouth and nose, exhaling a gentle puff and checking the state of affairs. The delicate receptors in his nose picked up the subtle fragrance of the triple cheese gouda tortellini and garlic pesto he tried to eat that day. It was a foolish behaviour to do for someone of his specie, a star child who consumes fire and has been dead for eons - ***I... uhms... sorry*** - he replied in a soft tone, low enough for Sam to hear - **I have deemed you worldly...**

**Worthy** - corrected the Wolf.

**Wordy! Yes, wordy of bribery** - continued the Tiger.

*Bribery?* - doubted the Turtle trying to understand what the Tiger tried to imply.

*No Tiger... You meant Bravery* - corrected the Spider.

The Tiger shifted poses revealing he was uncomfortable with the current stream of events - **O'rite! Enough! Dis kid is good.** - he cleared, dismissing Sam from his presence and focusing on Hannah.

**Ok den. Wut do we have here?** - said the Tiger inspecting Hannah - **A cute little girl!**

*"A ‘cute little girl’? Isn't that a sexist and misogynistic comment?"* - snapped back Hannah to the, now, terrorised eyes of the Tiger.

**No! I... I wasn't... I would never...** - the Tiger struggled to make a coherent expression.

*"Then why the remark of ‘cute’ or ‘little’ or even ‘girl’ have anything to do with it? Aren't you trying to take us to the trial?"* - continued Hannah with her sassy attitude towards the elder.

The Tiger gave a furtive look to the Bat, who seemed to enjoy Hannah's comment and the Tiger's awkwardness. The Tiger finally added - **Look gi... erm... kid. I just need to check you out.**

*"Pardon me!?"* - replied Hannah feeling appalled - *"You need to ‘check me out’? What am I, a piece of meat?"*

From the spirit point of view the answer was clear - **Well, yeh.**

Hannah gasped.

The Spider covered her face after an audible slap.

The Turtle shook her head in disapproval.

The Bat had a wide grin as she found the awkward moment extremely amusing.

Sam tried to follow the intricacies of the dialogue.

Amir thought the Tiger's mask could do with a little bit less orange.

The Wolf leaned closer to the Tiger's ear and said - **Think about what you just said.**

*Dink about what I said* - thought the Tiger, watching Hannah up and down - *She **is** alive, she has meat and bones. We are spirits we have... not-meat and not-bones... Why is dis girl look at me like I am a pervert?* - A moment of clarity that could only be illustrated with a device of electrical radiance hanging over his head.

**Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no! I did'n mean it dat!** - said the Tiger felling anguish flooding his paranormal existence - **I meant dis! Pop!**

A yellow flash materialised into an orb, hovering above Hannah's head.

**Ah good, you've a blessing. If is alrite with you I'll go to da next. Sorry to boder you** - said the Tiger, feeling relief and thinking - *Even if dis girl didn't have a blessing. She has lots of attitude to talk about her.*

*"This trial feels a little bit more like an interview!"* - said Amir in an attempt to lighten the mood.

**Oh? I fought you were not paying attention** - said the Tiger, amazed at Amir's remark.

*"Paying who?"* - Amir continued to joke, feeling relief the Tiger was such a jolly fellow.

**Ha ha, dats a good one.** - replied the Tiger - **But tell me, what do you have to show for?**

Amir's flame sunk deep into his chest as the words echoed in his ears - *"What do I have to show?"*

 **Yeh... You've no blessings... Why should I fink you are wordy of mine?** - replied the Tiger.

Amir felt in a tough spot. Feelings of guilt rushed through his entire body as he remembered the time Sam almost fell into the void because his carelessness. He remembered Hannah's anger piercing through the air like daggers shot with a tank, if there was such a think in this world. The more he searched, the more he felt an external force squeezing his flame. In the awkward silence he deviated a glance towards Sam.

The Tiger broke Amir's plead for help - **Boy! Stop looking for your friends. I need your answer, not deirs.**

*"We have come this far... that must count, doesn't it?"* - he added.

**A leaf floating on a river can travel from da forest to da ocean. It had to do nofing. It was all da water.** - replied the Tiger. For an instant, the Tiger examined Amir's pose, it had turned submissive. The bright yellow eyes seemed to glow stronger than the flames around the spirit - **I fink I have found da weakest like in dis chain. You are coming wid me.**

*"I am not weak!"* - refuted Amir. His tone of voice was closer to a tantrum than to a protest.

**Oh yeh?** - challenged the Tiger - **Tell me dis: would you be able get da blessings widow your friends?** 

Amir froze thinking about this phrase. He remembered how Sam came to rescue them when they found themselves stranded, followed by the darkness in the eyes of the Spider and Hannah saved them. The last lingering thought floated near Sam's head, the lime coloured orb - *I should've got that, but it is his now.*

*"We are a team"* - protested Sam - *"We have done everything together! He saved me more than once!"*

"We got out of Earth thanks to him!" - added Hannah.

*"And almost got you killed"* - replied Amir simply.

*"Nothing in there was real!"* - argued Sam.

**Everything in here is real, child** - intervened the Wolf - **If you found strength and courage by thinking there is no risk, fine by us, but the risk here is real!**

*"But... the girl told me it isn't!"* - Sam replied.

*"I told you already Sam. You are risking your lives here, for real."* - commented the Bat - *"The journey you are going to embark is dangerous and difficult. We would prefer to take your lives here than to leave your flames stranded and suffering who knows where."*

**And dis guy, as he is, will be your downfall for sure.** - finished the Tiger.

Those words destroyed whatever little confidence Amir had in himself.

*"Their downfall?"* - said Amir, more to himself than anybody in particular - *"If I go, I don't want any harm done to my friends... please?"*

**Den, come wid me** - replied the Tiger extending his gigantic hand declared with sharp claws - **I'll test ya**

*"And then what?"* - asked Hannah challenging the value of the test.

**If he got what I want, I'll let him go.** - replied the Tiger.

*"If he doesn't?"* - Hannah felt for the very first time since she left the Earth's trial, terror. The image of Amir's face turning into stone flashed momentarily.

**Den you two can go** - he replied. There was no doubt about the future of those who didn't meet the criteria. The Tiger jittered his hand in front of Amir - **Let's go boy.**

*"He is not going alone!"* - said Sam filled with frustration launching himself forward, but the Turtle foresaw his actions and had secured Sam in place by holding his shoulders. For such a fragile looking spirit she was surprisingly strong.

*If he doesn't go, you all fail the trials* - she replied - *All your efforts would be in vain.*

Amir's eyes were fixated on the Tiger's claws. He was afraid of what was about to come next, he was terrorised what it would happen otherwise. Finally, he reached to the open claw and placed his hand on it.

A tower of red flames burst from the ground shallowing the enormous spectre holding the hand of a little frighten child.

# Comprehending reasons

A loud thud shook the ground a few feet behind Yule with such force that ripples made the water lilies sway back and forth. She watched with disillusion how the flowers retreated slightly into their protective cocoons and without any other reaction she said - *"Paul, you just scared the flowers. Doesn't it hurt your knees when you land like that?"*

*"Not really, you know? You just swoop, shwoop and thump! Then you are on the ground striking a superhero landing! Looks cool, you know?"* - replied Paul.

Yule remained impervious of Paul explanation, her attention seemed to be focused on the pond in front of her.

*"Anyways... What are we doing here?"* - said Paul attempting to strike conversation.

*"Aren't you forgetting someone?"* - replied Yule ignoring Paul's question.

*"Huh? Oh yeah! Matt is coming with me... I think. He should be here any second now."* - he replied closing up the distance from where he just left an indentation on the cobbles around the pond and Yule.

Strands of his white long hair had begun escaping its restrains due to the sudden and forceful landing. He sat on the ground, close enough to Yule that they could enjoy their company without breaking personal space, far away enough he felt safe from her commanding presence - *"So... what are you doing?"*

*"I **was** playing with the little fish in here before a tremor scared them away."* - she replied blandly.

*"Trevor? I thought that lad was so lazy he would never leave the village at the bottom of the twin mountains."* - said Paul in a way to continue the conversation.

*"Paul, I meant I was dipping my feel in the water"* - clarified Yule.

*"Alright! That sounds fun!"* - he replied and dragged his posterior closer to the edge in preparation to follow Yule's actions.

*"Don't!"* - she said promptly, making Paul flinch for a second - *"Your feet are dirty and this is sacred water."*

Paul looked at his feet, soil crumbs covered most of the bottom and his toenails were framed my the dirt trapped under it. He moved his legs away from the water and observed Yule's pristine feet - *She must not know how good it feels to roll on the grass* - he thought resting his feet at a good distance from the superbly decorated edge of the pond.

*"Whatcha thinking?"* - asked Paul.

Yule flinched a second as her thoughts returned to the present - *"I guess I was thinking about what to do next."*

*"Maybe you were thinking on the little dudes"* - he added. Yule felt a little bit surprised by the accurate prediction and gave him a gentle smile back.

*"Do you think the little dudes are alright?"* - he asked causally, his distant mind trapped in the feeling and smell of the grass on his face.

*"I think so, yes."* - she replied.

*"Because they have been there for days now..."* - he continued.

*"Well, some take longer to succeed."* - she reaffirmed with positive conviction.

*"Or they just stay there consumed by the trials..."* - he followed in a more negative note.

*"Yes, some were and will be consumed but others exit victorious."* - she tried to reaffirm her positive way of thinking.

*"Or they die miserably at the hands of the spirits..."* - he added.

*"Regardless, they will emerge well and alive from the trials."* - she stated, her tone of voice a little off beat from her usual self.

*"Or join the large group of lost ones. The ones who lost their mind..."* - he added.

Yule's eyebrow twitched a few times. She took a deep breath in an attempt to remain calmed - *"Thanks for your commentary. I find it reassuring and calming, but, could you please reserve them to yourself?"*

Paul might not have been the most adept user of the language but, he understood sarcasm quite well - *"Yeah, Ok!"* - he replied - *"I just remembered when we did the trial, you know?"*

Yule smiled slightly to Paul's words - *"Yes, it has been a while since we did it."*

*"Yeah man! We destroyed the trials, you know!?"* - added Paul feeling the excitement of the remembrance.

*"Just a few short days"* - remembered Yule.

*"The four of us were unstoppable. Tere got the water blessing, I got earth, you air and Charlie..."* - Paul stopped the phrase halfway. Yule's sweet smile had been erased, her pose had contracted, withdrawn under her pink wings; her face barely visible. Her expression brought past memories to Paul's present telling him it was best to suspend the current conversation - *"I... I'm sorry, you know? I just remembered we had some pretty great days..."

*"I know Paul, it has been a long time since we returned to Dawn, isn't?"* - commented Yule in an attempt to compose herself - *"In those days you were always so serious and stressed. Theresa used to teased you for anything."

*"Yeah. Thanks to Tere I got my cool, you know?"* - continued Paul the train of old memories.

A tiny puff of air disturbed a few strands of Yule's hair, it was barely palpable but she noticed. Again, there was no reaction from Yule to acknowledge the arrival of another companion other than her words - *"Welcome Mathias."*

Paul turned around and found Mathias bent over, his hands rested on his knees and his face leaned, a stream of drops left his face hurling towards the ground. He took every deep breath as if it was his last. Mathias just raised his hand to acknowledge the welcoming and continued huffing in a battle to recover his normal breathing.

*"Wow Matt, what happened to you?"* - added Paul.

Mathias felt uncomfortable with his sweaty persona, he spread his wings in an attempt to cool down. His expression told Paul that he might be responsible. Mathias continued the struggle a few instants more before he managed to say - *"Wha...h happn... me? H..how... are... you... so bloody f... fast?"*

*"Fast? That wasn't fast, you know?"* - explained Paul - *"When I go fast I don't do woosh! I just go Ka-thumb pow!"* - his gesturing could have been interpreted as a missile leaving the ground up to interstellar space.

*"Huh?"* - said Mathias in an attempt to allow the puff of air leaving his lungs to allow his oxygen-deprived brain to kick in action and decipher Paul's comment. It was unsuccessful.

*"He said he can be much faster than that"* - translated Yule.

*"At least twice as!"* - added Paul.

Mathias gave up his fight with gravity, his muscles relaxed and softly dropped his body on the ground. As he laid there, he felt disappointed of his athletic performance.

*"Oi Matt! Are you dead?"* - added Paul.

*"Mmnuh?"* - replied Mathias, his face covered by grass and flowers.

Yule felt her placid enjoyment was long gone with the chatter - *"Now that both of you are here, what can I do for you?"*

*"Mehm wommumth wmmowoofmm mmemmoohums?"* - explained Mathias.

Yule's gaze went from Mathias to Paul - *"Care to translate what he said?"*

*"Sure thing!"* - said Paul - *"I am pretty sure he said ‘Mehm wommummth wommowoofoom memmoothooms’, almost positive, yeah..."*

Yule rolled her eyes - *"Thanks Paul, that was helpful."*

*"I said, how long are we going to wait for the others?"* - repeated Mathias, raising his face far enough from the ground that he could feel he wasn't grazing anymore.

*"**I** will stay here a little longer. I want to be indulged by the placid atmosphere in this temple"* - she commented whilst her eyes travelled thought the intricate details on the wall, the decoration around the temple and finally back on Mathias.

Mathias observed curiously back at Yule, then looked at Paul - *"Do you always pick stray dogs?"*

Paul expression changed to cheerful expectation - *"Are there puppies here?"*

*"No Paul, he means picking up the children we saw entering the trial"* - Yule

*"Ah! the little dudes. Right..."* - replied Paul, his head bobbing up and down.

*"So, do you?"* - pressed Mathias in an attempt to get an answer from Yule - *"I mean, I would understand if you pick up anybody. You picked me up."*

*"You are not a stray dog."* - immediately replied Yule.

*"Pff... You just don't want to hang with your bro, you know?"* - argued Paul - *"You are one of us now."*

Mathias felt slightly uncomfortable with the memory if his previous group and tried to push it aside in an attempt to find an answer - *"Well? Are you picking up these moths?"*

*"I think they have their own group, I just want to chat with them."* - replied Yule with her usual calmness - *"Besides, does it bother you if they do?"*

*"No... why would it?"* - dismissively replied Mathias - *"But, I thought we took decisions as a group and I don't remember you asking anybody"*

*"Paul, is it a problem for you?"* - asked Yule.

*"What is?"* - replied Paul trying to remember the last few seconds of conversation - *"Oh yeah, the little dudes? Nah, they look fun."*

*"Would Theresa mind if they do?"* - continued Yule in an attempt to demonstrate her point.

*"Doubt it."* - answered Paul - *"I think she wants to colour their wings! That is a definitely yeah even if she didn't say so herself."*

Yule once more turns to face Mathias - *"It doesn't seem to bother the rest."*

*"Ok, well... hums. I will lay it out, here and now"* - said Mathias a tad irritated - *"I think this is a waste of time. We followed you because you said you needed to come here. Was the grand plan to just wait for moths?"*

*"Contrary to your believes Mathias, I do not have clairvoyance"* -  replied Yule. She was feeling stressed due to Mathias' scrutiny - *"I didn't know we were going to find these children about to take the trials."*

She took a few steps around the edge of the pond as she tried to find a better argument to their presence there. She didn't - *"I just felt that I had to come here."*

Mathias lifted his arms in dissatisfaction with her explanation. In his mind, they came here looking for an adventure; instead they have been waiting to become nannies of some newly arrived children.

Paul watched Mathias walking in circles - *"Matt, we have a lot of time on our hands, you know? We don't have a specific work to do, chores nor anything like that... You need to chill!"*

Mathias gave a nasty look back to Paul clearly stating - *I am chill, I am so chill people would call me captain ice!*
Paul interpreted the look as - *Oh noes, he has a grain of sand in one eye and the other one is twitching!* 
This was usually the subtext of their attempts to establish a telepathic communication, or should we say, miscommunication.

Yule stopped her aimless meandering around the pond reaching a conclusion - *"Mathias, you are not forced to stay here and wait with me."* - with an elegant gesture she turned to face Mathias once more - *"Go ahead to Prairie or Forest, I will catch up with you later. Paul and Theresa can go with you... Paul said a few times he wanted to train you."* 

*"That would be so sick!"* - said Paul excitedly - *"I can show you how to fly properly my dude! I can show you the ropes."*

Mathias' stare went from Mathias to Yule - *"And what? Are you going to stay here alone?"* - a hint of sentiment and regret tinted his words.

She returned her gaze back on the water - *"I won't be alone for long. I will be all right."*

A gentle breeze caressed the flowers around the children, particularly Yule's feathers. From Mathias point of view, it seemed as if the wind carried particles that glistened as soon as it touched the pink and red ribbons decorating her wings, she always had that aura and gentle personality that could move mountains. He could see it in his imagination, Yule walking towards a mountain asking politely but firmly to move; the mountain would grow thousands of legs and move as she wanted it.

After some consideration, Mathias just managed to say - *"If that is what you want."*

*"In that case, let me get Tere!"* - said Paul spreading his wings in preparation to take off - *"I'll be right back"*

Mathias wasn't certain, but he thought there was a 'kaathumb' sound as soon as Paul launched himself up into the sky. He moved with unnatural speed towards the clouds to the side of the temple and went off view a few seconds later.

Mathias was conflicted with the current predicament. He wanted to seek adventures and enjoyment, but he didn't want to spend days waiting for some random children in a cave. The little voice of his consciousness told him he envied the attention Yule had dedicated to the newcomers, he quickly shook the thought off his mind - *"I can't say I know you as well as Paul or Theresa but, you always look so lonely."*

Mathias did not expect Yule's sweet reaction. She gently turned to take a deep look into Mathias eyes, her pinkish lips drawn into a light smile - *"Alone my dear Mathias, I might be alone but never lonely. These are two different things. I like to be with my own thoughts and to achieve that I need solitude."* - Her words were filled with an invisible candour. He knew the others followed her out of respect but, it was at this precise moment that he understood the quality of her persona; she wasn't the strongest, fastest or overall more capable to lead others. She just had a certain... something that made you want to follow her until the end of the world.

He watched her return to her study of the pond. He tried to double down on his enquiry - *"Are you sure you want to stay here?"*

*"Undoubtedly"* - Yule said dismissively.

*"May I ask a final question?"* - said Mathias in an attempt to continue the conversation.

*"You just did"* - replied Yule entranced in the detailed dance between the inhabitants of the pond.

*"Oh!"* - managed to say Mathias realising he has been dismissed.

*"But you may ask another question if you like."* - she replied absently.

Mathias felt the envy bug eating him away, his curiosity was overflowing with thirst and he was going to quench it now - *"Why wait?"* - He waited for a moment. Yule didn't seem to acknowledge the question so he followed it - *"Why wait for these moths? We have seen many on our way here, you didn't stop for any one of them. So why these?"*

Yule's gaze lifted from the pond up to the skies, she wondered about his question, finally answering - *"I guess, they caught my eye."*

Mathias wasn't satisfied with this answer, it was as good as answering ‘just because’. He tried to press on and get a proper answer - *"These past few months I met you, I have never seen you do that for anybody. Many others have asked for our help or guidance, you sent them away. Why them?"*

*"Is that another final question?"* - replied Yule. Her soft voice was adorned with dangerous harshness - *"I am afraid you have run out of final questions for now. Perhaps you should try to catch up with Paul while you can."*

Mathias remained awkwardly observant of Yule's back. He wanted answers - *"But..."*

*"You must be urging to go and prepare yourself for Paul's training. After his displayed of prowess, you must be eager to follow Paul and excited for his insights."* - commented Yule casually, though Mathias felt it was an explicit order to leave.

*That's Yule for you, she always manages to persuade people into thinking they should leave her as we have things to do, instead of she ordering us to leave her alone* - thought Mathias. He took a final look at her and added - *"Right, thanks! I'll be on my way then."*

*"Good man. Enjoy your training"* - she replied.

He extended up his bright red wings in an attempt to gather as much propulsion as possible and froze in place. His eyes travelled from one cloud to another.

*"Thirty-five degrees to your right in straight line, that's where Paul will be waiting for you."* - she added.

Mathias turned once more to watch Yule's back. He was puzzled about how she knows these sorts of things. He flapped with all his might and took up to the skies.

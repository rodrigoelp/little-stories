# Palpitations

Once more, the world was spinning in Amir's head. The coldish soft sand and flickering shadows gently dancing on the ceiling told him they had returned to room buried deep in his memories. The Earth trial seemed to have last an eternity.

His eyes travelled from the playful figures involved in the silent waltz to the rocky wall and eventually, to the statue of a young woman sitting with her legs crossed; she wore a spider mask decorated with eight crystal eyes fixated on him. He wasn't sure if all eight eyes were fixed on him, maybe two or three at least would be checking him out, he thought. As things with Amir would go, he started to wonder if spiders could suffer strabismus.

*"Are you Ok?"* - said Hannah's soft voice next to him.

He smiled slightly to the rhythmic beat of his flame, which had changed its pace from slow to strong and fast. He thought others might be able to hear the ‘thump-thump’ getting louder -*"Hey!"* - he said turning his face to look at Hannah's bright amber eyes.

He wanted to move his arm, in an attempt to lean on it to look cooler, but he couldn't. Hannah's tight grip prevented his hand from escaping.

*"How do you feel?"* - asked Hannah, she felt a little awkward now that her feelings were out in the open.

*"Yeah... all good. How do you feel?"* - replied Amir.

*"Overall, great. Happy. And you?"* - answered Hannah, almost immediately regretting it as she knew she had asked that question already.

*"Aaaaaargggggr... what an incredibly dull conversation!"* - said Sam a little irritated with the awkward couple - *"Next thing you will start asking is about the weather. If you two will just use ‘Hi’, ‘hello’, ‘I'm good and you?’ I swear I will just walk away, straight to the spectre outside and request for my death!"*

*"Sam, what's up with you? Are you jealous?"* - asked Hannah with a hint of cheekiness in her voice - *"I got to tell you, there are plenty of moths in the sky."*

Sam rolled his eyes and stood up, walking towards the entrance of the room.

*"Where are you going buddy?"* - asked Amir

 *"I'll go and talk to the spectre right now."* - replied Sam.

*"What? Are you really going to ask it to kill you?"* - enquired Amir, a hint on anxiety could be noticed.

Sam stopped by the entrance as if he weighted the benefits and the cons of the idea - *"I just want to finish all these trials. Plus this room feels a little too small for a third wheel."* 

*"Oh, come on Sam! Sam! Sam?"* - said Amir watching Sam's back exit the room. He remained undignified with his hand pointing towards the empty space Sam used to occupy a few instants ago and turned to face Hannah - *"He just bloody ignored me!"*

*"It's Ok. He will be Ok"* - she replied. Hannah felt the awkwardness raising once more but she didn't want to go back to the meaningless questions. She knew Sam was right, the conversation was pretty dull - *"Hey, about what happened towards the end..."*

Amir felt a little timid towards Hannah sudden assertiveness - *"You mean the spider lady biting Sam? Or biting me? The casual confession of your intense feelings towards me? You getting the flame the spider lady gave you? You gotta be a little more specific..."* 

*"The confession part..."* - Hannah's assertiveness seemed to have disappeared - *"How do you feel about it?"*

*"Yeah, we are good! I feel good, thanks!"* - moronically said Amir. He wanted to confess as well but, in the microsecond his brain had formed the thought his lips had moved and the phrase came out of his lungs - *"I mean. It was nice; I liked it, like, I liked hearing about it... like, I heard you love me and I was like, right, what is love? Baby don't hurt me, no more. But that was a song, I think, but I was nice, you know what I am trying to say?"*

Hannah noticed Amir's nervousness and she really tried to understand the string of words but the content was so diffuse and confusing that she just replied with - *"Not really. No."*

Amir felt the pressure of her stare, for some reason his mouth felt incredibly dry - *"Is there a little bit a water here?"*

*"Maybe outside but, could you give me a clearer answer?"* - replied Hannah feeling her flame sinking deeper into her chest. A little hint of pain made her release Amir's hand as she draw it closer to her body. She looked somewhat smaller and fragile than ever before.

Amir caught most of the signals and stretched his arm securing her hand in his - *"Don't let go, Ok? I am here... I just don't know how to say it."* 

Silence reigned over the candlelit room for an instant as the shadows dancing on the walls had stopped. It feel as if the entire room was watching expectantly for a kiss. The silence was broken by Sam's unintelligible voice echoing from the chamber outside.

*"He might be talking to the spectre"* - replied Amir - *"Shall we go with him?"*

Hannah nodded and walked towards the entrance of the room, followed by Amir who tightened his grip on her hand. She felt the feeling was nice though her heart was aching.

The shadows watched the pair leave the room.

The flames on the candles started to dwindle blurring the lines between the shadows and the darkness in the room.

The eyes of the spider glowed in the dark. Grains of sand slipped of the surface of the statue and rushed towards the ground, disappearing on the ground.

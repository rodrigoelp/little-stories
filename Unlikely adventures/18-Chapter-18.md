# Finger paintings

Hannah felt uncomfortable not being able to hear footsteps at all. It made the silence even more unbearable and awkward, a silence that previously was kept distant by Amir providing commentary. She didn't dare to turn around and face the aftermath of her anger.

*If I were to walk slowly, they would catch up with me and we would leave everything behind.* - she thought filled with remorse.

Words bounced off the walls into Hannah's ears. She heard clearly when Amir shot down Sam's attempt to strike conversation. Amir was clearly bumped down as she blurted down all of those negative feelings. She hated herself at this moment, she wanted to apologise but she remembered that - *words are like water spilled on the ground. It is difficult to take back, especially if the ground is filled with this much sand.*

She felt an even heavier load on her shoulders.

Her slow pace turned into a feet dragging motion. Her heart was sinking with guilt.

She pushed herself to walk, the motion allowed her to, somewhat, focus on the path as opposed to the horrible things she said. As she turned left or right, she battled with the idea of continue by herself, granting some space to breathe and leave the frustration behind, or go back and hug Amir as she asked for forgiveness.

She felt like the second option was better, she ran back in an attempt to find Sam and Amir. It wasn't successful as she found herself alone in a completely new corridor.

*"Sam?"* - she asked tentatively to the void.

There was no reply.

*Oh, that's great! Now I am lost* - thought Hannah, swiftly inspecting her whereabouts and her tracks - *I am completely sure I came from here*

She walked down the corridor, turned right then twice left and finally right again.

*Yup, I can't remember this spot either.* - she thought getting upset at herself.

*Think girl, you got to find your way.* - she continued the thought.

*"Sam?"* - she enquired again to no response. Her anxiety had started to show. Her mind show her terrible situations in which Sam and Amir got themselves into and by now, they must be at the death's door, or at the very least at its porch.

She shook her head as if the movement would dislodge the thought - "Sam? Can you hear me?"

There was no reply.

Another turn to the left, another sprint for three hundred metres and another dead end.

*Did they leave without me? No, no, they wouldn't... would they?* - Hannah had started to discuss with herself - *Maybe they found the way out and I am stuck here, because I yelled at Amir. I said such horrible things to him.*

*"Amir?"* - she called. Then she lower her voice and said - *"I'm sorry. I didn't want to say those things. I am the silly head."*

The walls observed at the girl getting increasingly depressed. The walls decided to motivate her releasing a few pebbles metres away from her. 

*"Hello? Sam? Amir?"* - she queried followed by her thoughts -  *Of course it was nothing.*

Another ‘plop’ echoed on the walls and reached her.

*"Uhm, Sam?"* - she called again.

‘Plop, plop, plop!’, echoes called her into action. She sprang up and into a dash trying to find the source of the sound as she continued to call for her companions. A turn left, followed by a long corridor, then two right turns and another turn left.

*"Sam! I swear if you guys don't answer I will punch you so hard!"* - she said aloud, mostly to herself in an attempt to not feel so lonely.

*"What did I do? We've been standing here for a while!"* - replied Sam.

*"Sam?"* - queried doubtfully Hannah, not believing the stream of words that reached her senses.

*"Yeah... where are you?"* - asked Sam. Hannah felt his voice was close.

*"Where's Amir? Where are you?"* - asked Hannah secretly happy.

*"With me... I asked first, but, whatever. We found another gate."* - stated Sam.

Hannah followed the echoes of Sam's voice, another turn right and she saw them. Amir sat on the floor, staring at the gate. Sam waved his hands in the air.

*"How did you two got her so quickly?"* - asked Hannah but followed her question with a statement, effectively leaving Sam with the answer in his mouth - *"Is that the gate? It looks gorgeous!"*



Hannah got her eyes fixed on the gate; she felt suddenly ashamed of herself when her eyes and Amir's met briefly.

The corridor framed the gate perfectly. The squared gate would have been missed if it wasn't adorned with eight quartz crystals connected with crystalline lines, there was no relieve or carving done to this door.

Each crystal glowed with its pale blue light. 

*"I think this is the gate of the Collector"* - stated Hannah. She waited a few seconds for Amir to interrupt in an attempt of a joke, yet, nothing happened.

*"The gems are organised in the shape of the vase is his constellation. You can see it as the eight stars connected by the lines draws it. I can't see a note on the frame or a sign"* - she added.

*"I know. We checked the gate already, isn't bud?"* - stated Sam looking at Amir. There was no response.

*"In any case, look closer, there are two smaller crystals in there. What are those?"* - said Sam.

*"I think... Uhm... I don't know"* - she replied observing curiously at the missed detail - *"the constellation doesn't have any these stars in it."*

Sam wanted to ask Amir for his opinion but, he remained seated  a few metres away from the frame, staring at nothing in particular.

*"Don't you think you were a little harsh back there?"* - said Sam softly at Hannah.

Hannah wanted to apologise to Amir but, she wanted to apologise without Sam overhearing the conversation - *"He will be fine. I will talk to him later."*

*"I've never seen him like this"* - said Sam with a tone of self reflection.

*"I... I'll talk to him once we have finished this trial."* - she said trying to quiet down her guilt.

*"But he really is not himself"* - restated Sam.

*"Sam. Let's focus on getting out of here."* - she stated promptly before Sam continued pushing for a resolution - *"The faster we get out of here, the faster I will get to talk to him."* 

*"Oh..."* - said Sam doubtfully - *"Ok."*



Hannah refocused on her research of the gate and the now ten quartz stones gently glowing back at her. She knew quite well her constellations, there was something strange about the collectors with those extra quartz.

*"Why was it called the collector?"* - asked Sam casually, entranced on the featureless texture on the gate.

*"‘He’, Sam. He was a ‘he’ as opposed to ‘it’. The collector was beloved, try to be more respectful"* - clarified Hannah with the same tone a grand mother would correct a grandchild's letter after she spotted a 'your' instead of 'you’re'.

Sam didn't reply.

*"In any case, the collector used to gather butterflies. He had a vast collection of every single type you can imagine. Big and small, sleek and rough, every single colour you can imagine."* - she answered - *"The tale says, he used to carry a large vase everywhere, chase butterflies and catch them with his big hands, carefully storing them in the vase."*

*"Huh, that's sad"* - replied Sam - *"Imagine spending your entire life in a vase."*

*"No Sam. He didn't keep the butterflies imprisoned in the vase"* - she added - *"he used to open the vase and let them go."*

Her voice resonated in the figment of her imagination.

A mental image had formed of a giant person, opening a jar and letting go tiny glowing creatures flapping away. She moved her hand closer to the pair of gems, foreign to the vase pattern and moved her finger around it, drawing the shape of a butterfly around each stone. She was surprised to find that her fingers dug deep into the stone of the gate as she followed her imagination and completed the pair of insects.

*"There!"* - she said, stepping away from the gate to admire her creation. The gate now displayed a vase with two butterflies been released. She smiled gently.

A sudden grinding sound shook the children. Even Amir jerked a little as the noise catch him unprepared.

The gems encased with the outlined butterflies glowed in golden light. The groove Hannah left behind on the sandstone had started to be filled by liquid crystal, or so they thought, as the beautiful shapes filled with golden light.

The crystal butterflies seemed alive as the gates revealed yet another passage deeper into the maze.

They faced another wall. Another selection of challenges to tackle.

Sam nudged his friend and helped him stand as Hannah ventured forward.

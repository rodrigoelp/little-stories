# Earth shattering

Puffs, huffs, puffed huffs and huffed puffs echoed down the slide, where three children remained on the floor out of fear the jerking motion of their legs would send them plunging into nothingness.

*"At least, it was fun!"* - said Amir in an attempt to find a positive outcome to their current predicament.

Unfortunately, as things go, there are times when it is best to remain silent-and-sad than positive-and-cheerful. This was one of those opportunities Amir didn't take.

The words bounced against Hannah as a ball would bounce of the trigger of an explosive who just happened to wonder a little too close to a volcano about to erupt. Some of the frustration brewing in Hannah mixed with the empty space where her temper used to reside and she... erupted - *"Fun? FUN? Is everything a joke to you?"*

Amir looked in despair as a hare would look at... an exploding volcano. Unluckily for him, he was trapped between a wall and a Hannah, which is so much worse than a sword.

*"Fun! HA! All of this is your bloody fault! All of it Amir!"* - continued Hannah, red mist covering her judgement - *"We walked slowly and you ran! You made us fall! Why Amir? Just tell me, why do you take everything as a joke? There is nothing sacred to you! We almost fell there and you make a stupid joke!"*

*"I'm... sorry, ok? Please don't be ma..."* - Amir tried to contained the tsunami of hot magmatic anger overflowing Hannah. His apology made her angrier.

*"Don't get mad? Are you seriously going to tell me to calm down??? I asked you to help and you joked holding onto me! Back there with the riddle, how did you help? When have you been of any use???"* - Hannah's rationality had walked out of the metaphorical room, anger was driving her mouth now.

*"I am glad Sam is with us! If it wasn't for him I would still be stuck on a chunk of ice, listening to you and your silly blue foot!"* - she proceeded as she ignored Sam's hand gestures to ‘cut it out’

*"I try so hard to not be a deadweight in these trials... what are you doing, huh? Nothing!"* - said Hannah, as reason walked back in the metaphorical room and found a cluster of tables and chairs clashing against the walls, splintering into a million tiny pieces. 

The echoes remained bouncing through the corridors giving off the impression of thousand Hannah's yelling at Amir. Hannah hated the way she sounded as a new echo came through.

Sam had been covering his mouth with his hands in disbelief of the recent events, he could see Hannah slowly regretting her statements just now, but, she looked like the proud-kind. Amir was dead silent fixated on the ground.

Hannah stood up, shook her clothes clean, once again to no effect as their clothes didn't seem to get dirty, and walked away quietly.

Amir didn't move at all.

Sam couldn't even make up if Amir was breathing or not. He stretched an arm to reach to his friend - *"Ignore her. She is pumped with adrenaline out of the fright. She didn't mean any of that. In not time she will be..."*

*"She's right."* - interrupted Amir, his voice filled with sorrow - *"I've done nothing."*

*"What? That's so not true!"* - Sam tried to argue the current low-spirited Amir - *"Bud, you saved me back there and you have found some of the..."*

*"I'm sorry I let you down."* - interrupted Amir once more. His thoughts didn't allow him to understand the arguments Sam tried to convey.

After a while, the pair of friends remained speechless. Sam was unsure what was the right thing to say. He looked at his friend unable to break the gloom blinding Amir. His despaired was replaced with anxiety when Amir stood up and quietly walked in the direction Hannah had disappeared in.

Sam followed him a worried.

# Earth shattering

Puffs, huffs, puffed huffs and huffed puffs echoed down the slide, where the three children remained on the floor out of fear the jerking motion of their legs would send them plunging into nothingness.

*"At least, it was fun!"* - said Amir in an attempt to find a positive outcome to their current predicament.

Unfortunately, as things go, there are times when it is best to remain silent-and-sad than positive-and-cheerful. This was one of those opportunities, which Amir didn't take.

The words bounced against Hannah's mind, stress and frustration. All of it clumped together like a fluffy snow ball which would bounce off an already unstable ice sheet about to start an avalanche at the edge of a peak around the crater of a volcano that needed a teeny tiny push to erupt. Whatever it was brewing inside of her mixed with the tiny locked box containing her temper and she... erupted.

*"Fun? FUN? Is everything a joke to you?"* - she said increasingly more upset.

Amir looked in despair as a hare would look at... an exploding volcano coming its way. Unluckily for him, he was trapped between a wall and a Hannah.

*"What's fun about it Amir? Was it fun we almost dropped to the bottom of the abyss? All of this is your bloody fault! All of it Amir!"* - continued Hannah, red mist covering her judgement and good character - *"We walked slowly and you ran! You made us fall! Why Amir? Just tell me, why do you take everything as a joke? There is nothing sacred to you! We almost fell there and you make a stupid joke!"*

*"I'm... sorry, ok? Please don't be ma..."* - Amir tried to contained the tsunami of hot magmatic anger overflowing Hannah. His apology made her angrier.

*"Don't get mad? Are you seriously going to tell me to calm down??? I asked you to help and you joked holding onto me! Back there with the riddle, how did you help? When have you been of any use???"* - Hannah's rationality had walked out of the metaphorical room, anger drove her now.

*"I am glad Sam is with us! If it wasn't for him, I would still be stuck on a chunk of ice, listening to you complain about your silly blue foot!"* - she proceeded as she ignored Sam's hand gestures to ‘cut it out’

*"I want to be part of the group, to contribute so we can succeed on the trials but you, you don't take anything seriously! What are you doing, huh? Nothing!"* - said Hannah; reason had walked back in the metaphorical room and found a cluster of tables and chairs flying through the air, clashing against the walls, splintering into a million tiny pieces on contact. 

The echoes bounced back to her ears. Every single one gave off the impression of one thousand Hannahs yelling at Amir. She hated the way she sounded so unkind, so bitter, so petulant, so vexed with Amir. If she could think of more negative terms to describe herself she would. She wanted to analyse her behaviour at that instant but, her mood was too turbulent to think clearly at that moment.

Sam had been covering his mouth with his hands in disbelief of the recent events, he could see Hannah slowly regretted her statements, but, she looked like the proud-kind. Amir was dead silent fixated on the ground.

Hannah stood up, shook her clothes clean, once again to no effect as their clothes didn't seem to get dirty, and walked away without phrasing a single word.

Amir remained motionless.

Sam couldn't even make up if Amir was breathing or not. He stretched an arm to reach to his friend - *"Ignore her. She is pumped with adrenaline out of the fright. She didn't mean any of that. In not time she will be..."*

*"She's right, though."* - interrupted Amir, his voice filled with sorrow - *"I've done nothing."*

*"What? That's so not true!"* - Sam tried to argue the current low-spirited Amir - *"Bud, you saved me back there and you have found some of the..."*

*"I'm sorry I let you down."* - interrupted Amir once more. His thoughts didn't allow him to understand the arguments Sam tried to convey.

After a while, the pair of friends remained speechless. Sam was unsure what was the right thing to say. He looked at his friend unable to break the gloom blinding Amir. His despair was replaced with anxiety when Amir stood up and quietly walked in the direction Hannah had disappeared in.

Sam followed him worried.

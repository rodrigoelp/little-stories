# Celestial giggling

A tender breeze pushed the grass on a delicate dance, picking up the wildflowers' pollen, giving it a twirl or two as it playfully crossed the space between a temple's door and its patio, leaving the pollen almost imperceptibly on Virgil's forehead as he rested laid on the ground with his arms extended to each side.



*I could get used to this* - thought Virgil enjoying the mundane tasks of the immaterial world.



He looked up, the sun decided to change its perspective on the world; at this very moment, it was interested in the foreign spirit resting on the grass. A streak of light hit Virgil up.



 *"Hello Mister Star, you look radiant today!"* - saluted Virgil.



The sun mildly enjoyed the pun, gentle pulses descended of the star. Once the commotion had settled, another glimmer was sent to the spirit.



*"What do you mean by ‘suspicious’? It feels a tad insulting. Am I not memorable enough?"* - replied Virgil, waving his hand to the sun, in the same attitude a rock star would lower his sunglasses to a bouncer at a bar. For a brief moment, the sun remembered.



A series of glints descended to Virgil, apologetically.



*"We don't need the formalities, do we?"* - replied Virgil with a cheeky tone added at the end - *"I mean, if we are going to use our full names that is fine by me, Mr. HE1327-2326-ß"*



The star remained with a stable glow an instant then sent twinkle and a short sparkle.



*"Glad we cleared that out"* - stated Virgil.



The star sent a fickle.



*"I'm taking two young little stars to Eden"* - answered Virgil.

"... As their guide" - clarified Virgil.



The sun flickered for a moment or two, then flashed once.



*"They are in the trials. I hope they have completed the first one by now."* - replied Virgil - *"If I am honest, I am happy not knowing about those two."*



The sun shone incandescently.



*"Of course I do not wish anything bad to them."* - replied Virgil waving his hands in the air expressively - *"I meant, it is good to have a few minutes of fresh air before I continue with parental tasks. The separation makes me appreciate them more."*



A breeze flowed over the field, feeling slightly awkward as silence had overcome the conversation between the two entities.



"... If I remember correctly, you like jokes, right?" - asked Virgil nonchalantly.



The sun shimmered.



"Two parallel lines started talking online and really hit it off. They had so much in common" - a slight grin appeared on Virgil's face - "It is a shame they'll never meet."



The sun fulgurated intensely for a few minutes, then flicker weakly for a few seconds as if remembering the line, followed by a gleam and more fulgor.



*I've never seen a sun rolling on the celestial vault laughing* - admitted Virgil perplexed to the astronomical event.



The wind brushed his ropes bringing a sweet aroma which distracted him - *"Ah! If you excuse me, I got terrestrial matters to attend. It seems an old friend will be arriving soon."*

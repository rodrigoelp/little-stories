# Unexpected friends

The sweetness in the air was slowly fading from Sam's nose. The grassy sensation on his feet was replaced by a gulp of sand in his mouth and a world that had stopped spinning around.

Sam was temporarily blind as in an attempt to understand the last few events, the immovable rock crushing his toe memory became vivid as his toe was screaming top of its hypothetical lungs to his brain.

Holding his foot with both hands in an attempt to not scream words that could only be described with a series of high pitched tunes, he turns and realises the portal was gone, its frame fractured and the little green island he was standing not so long ago, vanished.

*Am I dreaming? what is going on here?* - He thought. Walked a bit closer to the empty fractured gate, staring for a moment to the vast sea. He dipped the aching toe in the water, its freshness made the complaining pulsing toe calm down. The now free mind realised the crunchy and unpleasant nature of the sand which he tried to remove by drinking a bit of the water onshore.

The saltiness wasn't pleasant either but at least he grinding was gone when he jaw clenched. His senses were adjusting again on the surrounding, it looked like the sun was just coming up behind a hill and the hill had a little cave, the entrance accessible away of a short walk. The sand felt slightly cool under his feet and his clothes were surprisingly clean after falling, rolling and landing hard on the sand. The wind was making an odd sound...

It sounded like... a voice, and it was calling him out:

*"... are you coming in or not? Stop standing there, chop-chop!"* - said the voice from the cave.

Against all good judgement and the feeling someone once told him *"if someone calls you from their cave, never get in. Remember, stranger danger!"*, he shook his linen garments trying to shake sand that wasn't there and ventured to take a peek inside of the cave.

*"Hello?"* - he said.

*"Yes, come in"* - said the voice.

*"Mister... what are you doing there?"* - said Sam doubtfully.

*"Look child, right now I don't have all the time in the world."* - replied the voice, monotonically. 

*"Where are we?"* - Sam was now stepping further into the cave. 

*"An isle"* - replied the voice.

*"Y... yes... I can see that Mister... but I was on a smaller... island until not so long ago... "* - Sam said, doubting his judgement.

*"Yes, that was a different place. It is called the hub. We're at Dawn now. You were just born now little child... though I have never seen anybody face planting their way into existence like you just did..."* - replied the voice.

Somewhat embarrassed and feeling his face burning, Sam tried casually to ask as he stepped deeper into the cave: *"... and you are?"*

Light zipped through the other end of the cave. It is filled with gravel, a scent revealing sweet water around and a few patches of green here and there. Sam hops on a few rocks, nearly falling on one of them, slippery from water dripping from the ceiling. Climbs to the top towards the light to be greeted by a young man, standing with his hands on his waist. The man could be described as a tall man with white hair, blue bright eyes hidden under a plain mask, sandals and somewhat translucent skin, translucent clothes, translucent hair, all of him was translucent. *"Holy FLOPS! What flop is wrong with you???"* - Sam said.

*"I... well... (sigh)..."* - said the man chest fallen - *"... you know, I never thought the conversation was going to start like this... I was expecting an 'Oh, hi! so seem rather impressive, my name is...' "* completed the young man gesturing to Sam as someone trying to get an answer out of a parrot.

*"Holy crab man, seriously! Look at you! What is wrong with you? I can see through you! Why can I see what's behind you?"* - said Sam inquisitively trying to understand the entity in front of him.

The young man realised how difficult was going to be the communication with the little child - *"I'll tell you what I am IF you tell me your name, ok?... so... we.... wait, what are you looking at now?"* said the young man impatiently to the distracted child who was now walking back to the cave.

*"Sssh, didn't you hear that?"* - said fine as another big splash echoed in the confined space of the small cave. As Sam got close to the edge a child emerged from the waters and started to laugh. The child shook his garments and crawled his way up to the pair looking eagerly to the new member.

The young man leans forward, closer to Sam's ear saying *"Watch and learn child, this is how to present yourself..."*

*"Oh, Hi... My name is..."* - started to say the newcomer, *"... Oh, my crab! What is wrong with him???"* - whilst extending his finger, pointing at the translucent young boy, his face full of wonder whilst the young man was utterly defeated and covering his face to quiet down his sobs of disappointment; making Sam feel pity for him, extending an arm to try to console him with a pat or two, but his hand went right through the ghostly intangible figure, under its breath a murmur could be heard *"... all this time nobody had treated me like this... if I looked different... these kids... no respect for their ancestors, none! ... trying to give a good first impression..."*

The spirit clears its throat (its spectral form anyway) and proceeds at loud: *"I... I am here as a guiding spirit, a good advisor to your adventures ahead, and I can answer some of your questions as you travel through the realms of... guys? Hello???"* - said unamused at the two children absorbed in a conversation with each other.

*"... very nice to meet you, Amir! My name is Sam"* - said Sam leaning forward and extending his hand, noticing a strange glow around both of them.

*"Hi, Samuel!"* - replied Amir.

*"No, no... Just Sam"* - replied Sam.

*"Hi, Justin Sam!"* - said Amir, trying to contain his laugher.

*"Dude... seriously? It is Sam, that is it, Sam and nothing else."* - Reproached Sam, getting slightly annoyed.

*Got the feeling these two will become really good friends and a huge pain in my astral arse* - thought the spirit.

*"Who's the ghost here?"* - said Amir cleaning joy tears of his eyes.

Sam looked at the young man up and down - *"Not sure"*.

*"Greetings! dear Sam and Amir. My name is...is..."* - the young figure scrubbed his brain... well, the astrophysical representation of his brain for a suitable name, one worth of the title ‘A good guide’.

*"Don't you know your own name?"* - said Amir

*"Of course I know... I just need to pick a good one... I think I will go with Virgil."* - said Virgil.

*"Oh, that sounds poetic"* - said quietly Sam, analysing Virgil in the process - *"Sounds like someone who would talk in prose... But you don't look like one of those..."*.

*"Why is that?"* - replied Virgil

*"I guess it sounds too sophisticated or artistic for you"* - said Amir thoughtfully - *"I would have thought your name is Bill"*

*"... just call me Virgil"* - said Virgil dismissively reminiscing times of a different life.

*"Perhaps Mortimer"* - said Sam peering into Virgils transparent self

*"It is settled, I'll go with the name of Virgil"* - stated Virgil

*"Sephtis then"* - continued Amir

*"You guys are testing me..."* - restrained Virgil 

*"Or maybe Doug"* - said Sam helpfully

The trio continued discussing possible suitable and equally unacceptable names for Virgil.

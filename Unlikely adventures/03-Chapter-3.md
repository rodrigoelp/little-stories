# Unexpected friends

The sweetness in the air slowly faded from Sam's nose. The grassy sensation on his feet was replaced by a gulp of sand in his mouth and a world that had stopped spinning around.

Sam was temporarily blind in an attempt to understand the last few events, the immovable-rock-crushing-his-toe memory became vivid as his toe screamed top of its hypothetical lungs to his brain.

Holding his foot with both hands in an attempt to not howl words that could only be described with a series of high pitched tunes, he turns and realised the portal was gone, its frame fractured and the little green island he was standing not so long ago, vanished.



*Am I dreaming? what is going on here?* - He thought as he stood up, trying to balance his weight on his good leg.



Walked a bit closer to the empty fractured gate, staring for a moment to the vast sea. He dipped the aching toe in the water, its freshness made the pulsing complaining toe calm down. The now free mind realised the crunchy and unpleasant nature of the sand which he tried to wash by drinking a few sips of the water onshore.

The saltiness wasn't pleasant either but at least the grinding was gone when his jaw swayed in his mouth. His senses adjusted again in the surroundings, it looked like the sun was just coming up behind a hill and the hill had a little cave, the entrance accessible a short walk away. The sand felt slightly cool under his feet and his clothes were surprisingly clean after falling, rolling and landing hard on the sand. The wind made an odd sound...

It sounded like... a voice calling him out:

*"... are you coming in or not? Stop standing there, chop-chop!"* - said the voice from the cave.

Against all good judgement and the feeling someone once told him *"if someone calls you from their cave, never get in. Remember, stranger danger!"*, he shook his linen garments trying to get rid of sand that wasn't there and ventured to take a peek inside of the cave.

*"Hello?"* - he said.

*"Yes, come in"* - replied the voice.

*"Mister, what are you doing there?"* - said Sam doubtfully.

*"Look child, right now I don't have all the time in the world."* - answered the voice, monotonically. 

*"Where are we?"* - Sam stepped further into the cave. 

*"An isle"* - replied the voice.

*"Y... yes... I can see that Mister. But I was on a smaller... island until not so long ago"* - Sam said, doubting his judgement.

*"Yes, that was a different place. It is called the hub. We're at Dawn now. You were just born now little child, though I have never seen anybody face planting their way into existence like you just did!"* - replied the voice.

Somewhat embarrassed and feeling his face burning, Sam tried casually to ask as he stepped deeper into the cave - *"... and you are?"*



Light zipped through the other end of the cave, filled with gravel, a scent revealing sweet water around and a few patches of green here and there. Sam hopped on a few rocks, nearly falling on one of them, slippery from water dripping from the ceiling. Climbed to the top towards the light to be greeted by a young man, standing with his hands on his waist. The man could be described as a tall-thin man with white short hair and pale whitish skin, bright blue eyes hidden under a plain mask, light pale linen garments with silver finishes, sandals and somewhat translucent skin, translucent clothes, translucent hair, all of him was translucent.

 *"Holy FLOPS! What flop is wrong with you???"* - Sam said.

*"I... well... (sigh)..."* - said the man chest fallen - *"... you know, I never thought the conversation would start like this... I expected an ‘Oh, hi! You look rather impressive, my name is...’ "* - awaited the young man gesturing to Sam as someone trying to get an answer out of a parrot.

*"Holy crab man, seriously! Look at you! What is wrong with you? I can see through you! Why can I see what's behind you?"* - said the inquisitive Sam trying to understand the entity in front of him.



The young man realised how difficult the communication with the little child was going to be - *"I'll tell you what I am IF you tell me your name, ok?... so... we.... wait! What are you looking at now?"* - said the young man impatiently to the distracted child who was now walking back to the cave.

*"Sssh, didn't you hear that?"* - said Sam as another big splash echoed in the confined space of the small cave.

As Sam got close to the edge a child emerged from the waters and started to laugh. The child shook his garments spraying water around and crawled his way up to the pair looking eagerly to the new member.

The young boy leaned forward, closer to Sam's ear saying - *"Watch and learn child, this is how to present yourself!"*

*"Oh, Hi! My name is..."* - began to say the newcomer, his face contorted at the sight of the translucent young boy - *"What the holy crab! What is wrong with him???"* - whilst extending his finger, pointing at the translucent young boy, his face full of wonder whilst the young man was utterly defeated, covering his face to quiet down his sobs of disappointment; it made Sam feel pity for him, extending an arm to try to console him with a pat or two, but his hand went right through the ghostly intangible figure, under its breath a murmur could be heard - *"... all this time nobody had treated me like this... if I looked different... these kids... no respect for their ancestors, none! ... trying to give a good first impression!!!"*

The spirit cleared its throat (its spectral form anyway) and proceeded loudly, overcoming the chatter of the children - *"I... I am here as a guiding spirit, a good advisor to your adventures ahead, and I can answer some of your questions as you travel through the realms of... guys? Hello???"* - said unamused at the two children absorbed in a conversation with each other.

*"... very nice to meet you, Amir! My name is Sam"* - said Sam leaning forward and extending his hand, noticing a strange glow around both of them.

*"Hi, Samuel!"* - replied Amir.

*"Samuel? No, no... Just Sam"* - replied Sam.

*"Hi, Justin Sam!"* - said Amir, trying to contain his laugher.

*"Dude... seriously? It is Sam, that is it, Sam and nothing else."* - Reproached Sam, getting slightly annoyed.

*Got the feeling these two will become really good friends and a huge pain in my astral arse* - thought the spirit.



Amir cleared his eyes of his joyful tears - *"Who's the ghost here?"* - said pointing with his thumb at the young man.

Sam looked at the spirit from top to bottom - *"Not sure"*

*"Greetings! Dear Sam and Amir. My name is...is..."* - the young figure scrubbed his brain (well, the astrophysical representation of his brain for a suitable name) for one name worth of the title ‘A good guide’.

*"Don't you know your own name?"* - said Amir skeptically.

*"Of course I know... I just need to pick a good one... I think I will go with Virgil."* - said Virgil.

*"Wow! That sounds poetic"* - said quietly Sam, analysing Virgil in the process - *"Sounds like someone who would talk in prose... But you don't look like one of those."*

*"Why is that?"* - replied Virgil.

*"I guess, it sounds too sophisticated or artistic for you"* - said Amir thoughtfully - *"I would've thought your name is Bill"*

*"... just call me Virgil"* - said Virgil dismissively reminiscing times of a different life.

*"Mortimer perhaps?"* - said Sam peering into Virgils transparent self.

*"It is settled, I'll go with the name of Virgil"* - stated Virgil.

*"Sephtis then"* - continued Amir.

*"You guys are testing me..."* - restrained Virgil .

*"Or maybe Doug"* - said Sam helpfully.



The trio continued discussing possible suitable and equally unacceptable names for Virgil.

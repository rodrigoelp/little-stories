# Drowning

The darkness eased the further Sam ventured deeper into the cave. The flame on his chest illuminated parts of the path in front of him. Light sipped through the cracks on the ceiling bouncing off large boulders casting soft fuzziness to the surrounding environment.

*"Amir?"* - yelled Sam, hearing echoes coming back after a few seconds, revealing the vastness of the grotto. He listened intently, just getting the sporadic drop splashing down on a pond of water - *"Amir???"*

The silence was worrying Sam, who continued deeper into the cave, his eyes seemed to have adapted to the darkness by now and he picked up speed moving deeper. The cave's walls were covered with engravings of all sorts, it was too dark to make up anything of it, so he pressed on looking for his friend - *"... Amir, I swear, I will strangle you as soon as I see you..."* - stated Sam annoyed with the lack of Amir.

*"... Sam..."* - echoed Amir's voice - *"... come.... water..."*

Sam rushed deeper into the cave skipping several steps at once as he ran over what seemed to be a naturally made staircase - *"I am coming!"* - yelled Sam, he would've tried to fly if he could see clearly ahead of him, the light wasn't enough.

In the rush, he kept bumping with stones and rocks on his way but he was determined to push through - *Ouch!* - He thought every time a new rock hit his kneecap.

*Tsk! Aaarggg!* - when a  sticking root seemed to grab his wings.

 *Woh-woh-aaaaah*! - when his feet stopped touching the solid ground and he fell straight into a circular pond with light beaming down to its centre.

He raised his head from bubbling in the water, noticing a small mount of sand in the middle of the pond resembling a little island. On it, a monolith with scribing on it.

```
Master your inner struggles

Vanquish your doubts, gain knowledge

Rise above adversity

Conquer your fears

  - Victory of the mind over the body, that's the way of the stars.
```

Each phrase had a symbol near it, Sam couldn't understand the last three. 

*The first one looks like drops of water* - thought Sam, sliding his fingers across the carved symbol.

***I sense ruckus in your heart, my child*** - a voice projected behind Sam, he turned around immediately slamming his back against the stone of the monolith. A spirit was barely visible, floating towards him from the pond towards the islet - ***without control, this disturbance will starve the flame and prevent it from shining... you must conquer the trial of water*** - continued the spirit.

Sam could detail the appearance of spectre from here, the spirit was wearing a mask of a black wolf, perhaps a dog, his robes looked primitive and worn out, his presence was similar to Virgil's in that it was translucent but he looked a lot less... real than Virgil.

*"Who are you?"* - stated Sam unsteadily - *"I am not afraid... at least not entirely."*

The spectre raised his hand pointing at something without losing focus of his attention on Sam - ***water, you must conquer the trial of water***.

Sam deviated the centre of his terror slightly noticing a small flame lighting a set of stairs covered by dry moss, at the top of it an open door with a flicker revealing the presence of someone else - *"Amir??? Are you ok buddy?"* - said Sam, returning his gaze to the spectre.

***Water or I shall claim your light!*** - It seemed to be getting closer.

Sam's legs moved out of survival instinct, stumbling just a few steps falling face-first into the water. He stood up as quickly as possible, pushing water out of his eyes and nose and running up the stairs towards the lid doors. Running with terror, he turned around to inspect the monolith and the spectre but could only see the monolith from here.

His heart pulsed like a star about to go supernova, backing into the room without losing sight of the islet in case the spectre shows up, his feet got tangled and fell back, bumping against a statue of a man with a goat-turtle hybrid, under his legs, Sam saw the bodies of Amir and Hannah.

*"Amir? AMIR? HANNAH???"* - Sam shook their unconscious bodies, perhaps wasn't intentional, he was shaking too. There was no response, he looked at their chest and could see the flame was still lid and they were breathing - *"What's going on? Guys! Please answer me!"* - Sam started to fear for his friends' safety, they seem to be fine other than their eyes were rolled back and they were as stiff as sticks. 

His desperate eyes looked around in an attempt to find clues of what just happened.

The room, covered with soft sand, had candles flickering gracefully surrounding the statue standing in the middle; a gush of air coming from the statue, Sam could not help but to get close to the statue thinking - *Is it breathing?*

The statue rhythmic flux of air was charming for a second, Sam got close and then a bright flash of blue light came from its eyes.

A breeze woke Sam up - *"wh-wha?"* - mumbled Sam.

He was sitting on what appeared to be snow, his mind was fuzzy - *"How did I get here?"*

*"SAM!"* - yelled Amir holding Hannah's arm from an iceberg a decent distance away from Sam - *"SAM OVER HERE!"*

Sam's head was spinning - *I saw them just now, on the floor of the cave...* - thought Sam over his confusion - *"I... I'm coming, Amir, I'm coming!"*

Sam first steps were unsteady, he felt his head still spinning but he needed to gain control over his senses.

First, the vertigo had stopped, then his mind got sharper and he noticed it, the sensation of weight wasn't there.

That feeling of weight of his body pressing on his feet or experiencing the coldness the ice under him, none of it was there.

His eyes surveyed his environment - *is that snow?* - thought Sam not feeling the snow under his feet, he touched it, he couldn't feel it with his hands either - *and I am not sure it is day or night... the sky is just black* - continued Sam investigating the environment - *I just remember the soft sand before the statue... what happened? I am not in the cave any more...*

*"Hey Amir... where are we?"* - doubtfully said Sam whilst he observed the chain of islands linked by chunks of ice, and a strong tide washing over the islands periodically.

*"I would love to answer all your questions Sam, I'll get comfortable on this iceberg... "* - said Amir ironically.

Sam disliked this newfound personality Amir was displaying but, it would be better to fly to him and leapt forward to the aid of his friend... or he tried, he noticed a tad too late his wings were missing and fell into the incoming waves. One thousand daggers pinned his body as the freezing water touched him, he tried to swim but his arms went numb immediately and he sunk.

Consciousness slipped from his grasp as the last bubble of air left his body fading into the darkness of the deep ocean.

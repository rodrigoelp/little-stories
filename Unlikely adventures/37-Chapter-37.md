# Warm closure

Hannah's knee jiggled up and down, anxiety rushed though her body like anxiety would rush through someone expecting anything at any point in time and a narrator fails to describe the intricacies of that feeling that doesn't go away, in which you are panicking, the palm of your hands feel sticky and sweaty and for some reason, your stomach is trying to leave your body via your belly button.

She watched where Amir stood up before the Tiger took him away and a blaze so bright that even the flames on the candles in the room got extinguished.

*"And you guys really don't know what is going on?"* - asked Sam to the slightly annoyed spectres playing a game of cards.

***We shall not comment*** - replied the Wolf - ***Just focus on the task at hand.***

*"How hard is to just say, No, we don't know what is going on?"* - complained the Bat about to complete her game - *"Score! Check this out!"*

*Not again, this is the eleventh set in a row!* - complained the Turtle.

*"What can I say? I am on fire!"* - said the Bat - *"Figuratively speaking, of course... You know I can't do that sort of things..."*

*"And there is nothing you can do, right?"* - continued Sam - *"Like closing your eyes and teleporting to where they are and stuff."*

***There is one thing*** - added the Wolf dead serious - ***Remain in silence and let us play.***

Hannah left the comfort of the bench to crouch next to a dark circle on the ground. She touched the scorched area on which the Tiger and Amir had disappeared hours ago. It was hard for her to understand how that intense heat didn't consume the pair as they disappeared.

*Little girl, I've told you already, they are fine.* - said reassuringly the Spider - *Tiger can burn everything around him, but he would never harm your boy without a fair fight.*

Hannah's finger ran over the surface that once was loose sand but now it was a large glass plate that glistened with the soft light sipping through the cracks of the cave. She wanted to believe everything was fine, but her heart continued to ache with the presence of the unknown.

*"Could you at least tell us how long do we need to wait?"* - said Sam looking over the Wolf's shoulder, there was a glimpse in his eyes letting others to understand he was getting the game.

*I'm out!* - said the Turtle.

The Wolf gave a mean look at Sam - ***If we had a trial of discretion, you wouldn't even start the test before your flame would be extinguished.***

*"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was good to have the card with the three sticks and the one with the knight on the horse."*

*"I'm out too!"* - the Bat winked at Sam with pleasure.

Sam didn't want to pay attention to the Wolf. Somehow he felt the spirit might try to rip his head off - *"I'm really sorry."*

***Sit behind someone else, would you?*** - the Wolf shooed Sam away from his side.

*Your companion can be quite funny* - added the Spider in an attempt to establish small talk. She would have started complementing the weather, but the weather in the cave was always somewhat dusty and kind of humid.

Hannah didn't reply.

*Usually children are afraid of the Wolf* - continued the Spider, reminiscing about the past - *with the exception of one little girl and her boyfriend.*

Anybody watching Hannah could describe her as the literal definition of impervious.

*Hey! I'm talking to you!*

*"It's been a while since they left"* - Hannah said.

*Ok* - said the Spider - *But that's kind of expected.*

*"What do you mean?"*

*Oh... Well... How do I put this?*

*"Out with it, please?"*

*Right, even if your boyfriend...*

*"He is not my boyfriend"*

*... but you told him that you...*

*"Look, we have been stuck on these trials. I guess we haven't found the right time to talk things through, ok?"*

*Ah, yes. Alright. Even if your, uh, Amir, passes or fails quickly there might be other circumstances blocking their return*

*Or their arrival!* - added the Turtle joining the conversation - *I left the game, Wolfie is a little sore loser.*

***Watch your tongue, reptile!*** - yelped the Wolf still head butting with Sam.

*Hey! That's specist!* - protested the Turtle. The Wolf eyes rolled back.

*"What do you mean?"* - Hannah.

The Turtle and the Spider exchanged glances.

*The Tiger is quite a fierce spirit, you see* - Turtle.

*He is commanding and powerful* - added the Spider.

*A very imposing spirit if we should add* - Turtle

*"But what?"* - Hannah

*He sucks at directions* - completed the Spider.

Hannah expected a different comment about the spirit - *"What do you mean?"*

*My pretty littwe girw...* - the Turtle began talking, but stopped thanks to the loud inspiration the Spider did, a clear sign of her irritation with the Turtle baby talking to others - *Ok, ok, I won't do it again. Sowwy!*

*Tsk! Stop it!* - snapped the Spider - *Either way, the tests are done in a dreamworld, every spirit takes you to their own version which is deep in your mind. Unfortunately, more often than not, the Tiger gets lost.* - explained the Spider.

Hannah felt like the previous generations weren't as perfect as she thought they should be - *"Let me check if I got this right: you are telling me that should be calm because the insecure guy I like was hand picked by the scariest spirit to evaluate him on exactly his insecurities, but said spirit has no way how to get in or out?"*

The Spider thought about it, analysing and decomposing the words as best as she could - *Huh... if you put it like that it does sound a little bit bad, doesn't it?*

*But the Tiger has almost never failed to return* - added the Turtle.

*Yes, if we don't count that one time it took him one hundred years to comeback with the hammer girl.* - followed the Spider.

The Turtle considered the last statement and added - *Didn't that girl moved to the Hidden Forest later on?*

*Oh! And there was those other children... the gang of six or was it seven? I can't remember, they all went in with the Tiger and took a huge amount of time to come back too...* - the neurological pathways of the Spider allowed her to remember, but not to assess the current situation.

*"Yeah, hearing all of this is very comforting. Thanks!"* - snapped back Hannah whilst taking a seat, her leg jiggled so intensely that an engineer could have used it to demolish buildings.

***Worry not, child.*** - said patiently the Wolf from where he was sitting, his attention still focused on preventing Sam from reading his cards.

Hannah gave him a mean look - *"Oh yeah, and why is that? Are you going to tell me now that Amir isn't good enough and his flame is going to be devoured either way?"*

The Wolf sighed in an attempt to restrain his discontent having to explain too many things and remembered why he didn't have children when he was alive - ***No... look at the candles around you.***

Hannah noticed the disperse bundle of candles had been alight by some invisible force. The light was faint and dim, but that fact was changing quickly - *"What does it mean?"*

***What do you think it means?*** - replied the Wolf irritated.

Hannah felt a shockwave pushing her backwards as a column of amber and white fire appeared on the same spot Hannah had kneeled reviewing the scorched glass. The fire carefully danced around an invisible source of fuel, a source that began to take corporeal form. A form that brought many emotions to Hannah. She jumped straight into the flames and hugged Amir.

**WOW. Kids nowadays wait for nofing** - said the Tiger.

Amir was surprised by the sudden squeeze, but the surprise was quickly replaced with a big grin - *"Now this I call a warm welcome."*

*"Hi buddy! How did it go?"* - asked Sam from his chair, holding a hand full of cards.

Hannah's arms tighten around Amir, he hugged her back and limited himself to say - *"All good, I think."*

**Yeh, da boy was not too bad** - added the Tiger in an attempt to grab Amir's hand to proclaim him victorious, he found strong resistance from Hannah - **Oi, let da boy go, you are anafixating him.**

*"Asphyxiating him"* - corrected the Bat trying to get the upper hand on Sam by showing him her pair of Kings.

**Yeh, Dem too!** - continued the Tiger - **Wolf, you shoulda watch da boy, he summoned a freaking golem!**

The Wolf's eyebrow raised slightly - ***That child?***

**Yeh, he fought his fears with it** - answered the Tiger - **and he is almost done wid da test... Oi girl, could you let him go?**

Hannah blushed - *"Yes, I... I'm sorry."*

It may have been caused by the hypoxia, or the state of euphoria Amir was in, but it took him six full seconds for the words to reach the conscious part of his brain - *"... almost done? I thought we finished it back there!"*

The Tiger turned the focus of his bright yellow eyes towards Amir, it was the sort of gaze making you feel totally naked; and it wasn't the good sort of naked, it was the sort of naked you feel when you are dreaming you visited your boss' new house and somehow the place you used to change into your swimming suit is now located in the middle of a train station and there are a million people staring at you sort of thing.

**Da real test is here and now** - said the Tiger. He paused a second before his gaze drifted between to Sam and Hannah - **Face your fears, leave no room for it to hide.**

Amir had a series of flashbacks remembering the horrible phrases his fears told him taking the shape of his companions. It was true, the fear wasn't gone, it was just hidden in the most remote parts of his inner self. He swallowed loudly making a comical ‘Gulp’

*"Alright. I'll start with the easiest then."* - Amir proceeded to squeeze gently Hannah's hand - *"Wanna know what I saw in there?"*

*"It depends"* - hesitated Hannah, wondering if she was to blame for any of his inner most fears, or even worse, what if Amir's biggest fear was to be with Hannah?

*"I am afraid of not being good enough for you"* - Amir had begun blurting words out, trying to get the pressure off his chest - *"that one day, you'll grow sick of me and tell me you don't like me."*

Hannah noticed the little flame on Amir's chest flickering slightly, she reached out and touched it, the flame became burped and reignited with a few flares of red.

*"But so what I am not good enough?"* - Amir continued his thoughts without noticing Hannah's hand on his chest - *"I'll work myself to be better. I'll do anything I can to make you feel proud!"*

Hannah felt Amir had found the words to melt her heart entirely, not that she needed any help with that, but it was very effective. She let herself be embraced by Amir, whilst letting her voice out with certain muffled quality to it - *"You are so corny... It almost sounded like you are proposing..."*

Amir smiled and winked at the Tiger - *"Perhaps when we grow up. Let's take things one day at a time, yeah?"*

The Tiger smiled looking at the children.

The Turtle and the Spider gave themselves a hug. The Spider in particular felt the need to clean the debris making her eight eyes watery.

The Wolf looked at his playing hand and cursed the interstellar dust for not giving him a better hand. He looked at Sam and said - ***It's your turn boy.***

*"Here, two kings, the guy holding those funky branches and a dwarf"* - Sam was a little too happy for his own good.

The silver eyes of the Wolf glowed with anger - ***It does not count! I meant it is your turn to talk to your friend.***

*"But I am winning this round!"* - replied Sam.

***You shall talk to your friend or else I'll fail you all!*** - the Wolf sounded more serious than ever before.

Sam stood up almost immediately and left. The Bat took Sam's cards and gave it a good look - *"He had you against the ropes, huh? Two more turns and you would have lost."*

***Nobody asked for your commentary*** - said the Wolf grabbing the deck of cards and shuffling them quickly, just in case anybody returned to finish up the game.

Sam walked towards the crowd around Hannah and Amir, and by crowd it is clear it was three spirits, one of them could be accounted for ten or eleven others. Sam shouldered the giant, or a better description is, he shouldered the giant's hip, to make way towards Amir.

**Good, da boy is here** - said the Tiger feeling a gentle pushed - **Hey boy, stop da hanky panky stuff wida girl and talk to your friend.**

*Tiger, that's rude!* - said the Turtle shaking her head in disapproval.

**Wuss wrong wid it?** - he replied - **I read it in da dick... dick... wuss da name again?**

*Dictionarium manuale* - answered the Spider.

**Yeh, the fing of Emmanuel. It said it was like a hug and such** - said the Tiger.

The Spider had pulled the dictionarium manuale, found the definition and handed it to the Tiger. His limps moved slowly as he read each word carefully - **sumfing, sumfing, sexual surfing... Oh, I get it!** - said the Tiger, horrid realisation landed on him - **Yeh nah, I don fing dey are up to dat yet.**

Amir felt curious about the definition the Tiger just read - *"What was the something-something stuff you read? And what does it mean sexual?"*

Pink marks appeared on the Tiger's mask - **You're too little to know dis fings. Talk to your friend.**

Amir's curiosity was too strong - *"But just show me the page and I give it a quick look..."*

**I SAID TALK TO YOU FRIEND!** - replied the Tiger closing the book and throwing it to a sudden burst of flames. The book disappeared in between flashes.

First the very first time since Amir has known the Tiger, which to be fair it has been a few days by now, he recognised a murdering intent from the spirit. He turned sideways and whispered to Sam - *"We'll look for the book later, ok?"*

Sam nodded - *"What is it you have to talk to me?"*

Memories flooded Amir's present and finally looked at Sam straight on. Sam's eager expression gave him flashes of a very disappointed Sam just a few hours ago - *"Uhms... I don't know how to begin..."*

*"Whatever it is, don't give me the overly sweet speech you gave Hannah"* - said Sam with a playful and cheeky tone - *"I do not intent to have a romantic triangle with you and Hannah."*

*"Oh dear, NO! NO... NO... NO... NO... No, no...."* - emphatically reiterated Amir - *"UH huh, nope. That is N.O.P.E: Nope."*

*"Hey, I get it, you don't have to say it that much!"* - said Sam. There was a strange hint of resentment that lingered stating to the air ‘Do not worry, I love you in the most heterosexual way possible, but at times it feels nice knowing I got options even if I never want to use them’ sort of feeling.

*"Yeah no. Don't take me wrong, I think you are a handsome bloke and all, but..."* - said Amir in an attempt to sound less offensive.

**Wuss goin-on here?** - said the Tiger stepping back rising his hands up in the air, almost as if he realised he has been holding a device with a pretty set of lights counting the time in reverse and about to go boom. Hannah gave a crooked smile and a glance at the Tiger; it communicated ‘It is ok, they are awkward like that’.

*"Sam, do you remember when we first met?"* - Amir

*"Yes? It was on the shoreline just outside a cave, we were both lost"* - said Sam, he leaned closer to Amir whilst maintaining his eyes glued to Hannah and whispered - *"It was when we met Virgil."*

Amir felt anxiety, but he knew the time had come and going around the subject wasn't going to make it any less unpleasant - *"I saw the day you fell."*

Sam waited a minute, he didn't understand the context - *"You got to be a little more specific buddy. I have fall a lot since I have met you."*

*"No Sam, I meant on the little island"* - said Amir - *"The one with the round stone and the manta drawing on it. I was there. I saw you fall from the sky and onto that stone."*

Sam began to remember the feeling of the grass under his feet, the cold stone and the emptiness of the island - *"It is not possible. There was nobody there, I checked!"*

*"I arrived there, I guess the same way you did. I had no idea what to do"* - continued Amir - *"And I heard an old man calling me to go through the portal, but I was so scared that I hid and ignored him for a while, you know what they say right? Don't get in the portal of some strange old man, you never know what they might do to you!"*

Amir felt the excuse didn't reach the ears of his friend - *"Eventually the voice stopped calling"*

Amir felt conflicted if he should finish the story right there and then. Sam's friendly expression had changed to confusion.

The silence made Amir uncomfortable - *"Then you showed up, like you had everything figured out, you walked towards the portal like you knew what to do and you leaped in."*

Sam opened his mouth once more but Amir interrupted them before he could say anything - *"So, I followed you and your fearlessness, even when you began talking to... talking to you-know-who, I thought: ‘If I don't do anything, I'll miss the adventure of my life.’"*

Sam remained silent, watching Amir up and down with the sporadic scan of the others expressions. Amir anxiety grew with each second Sam remained silent - *"Aren't you going to say anything?"*

*"Is there any other anecdote to include?"* - replied Sam after careful examination.

Amir nodded expecting the worst possible outcome.

Sam worried expression - *"And you were afraid because?"*

*"I hope you do not think of me as a stalker. I just thought you were cool and brave."*

*"Ah... I see"* - said Sam in a very pensive tone - *"Amir, you are such an idiot. For a second I thought you were about to confess to a crime where you murdered everybody on the island and I was the one that escaped!"* - said Sam feeling relief - *"Were you really stressing about that?"*

*"Yeah.."*

*"You are a silly guy"* - reaffirmed Sam.

**Not silly. Fears are not irrational fings** - said the Tiger without a clear understanding of the usage of the phrase.

*"Rational, my dear Tiger"* - corrected the Bat.

**Isn't a ration like, how much I get of somefing?**

*"Yes, but I said rational"* - repeated the Bat.

**Rite, a ration all** - repeated the Tiger - **Where were we?**

*"Fear is irrational"* - repeated the Bat.

**But dats wut I said!**

The Bat gave a look at the Tiger, pondering about the futility of trying to grab fire with a strainer, she extended her arms and hugged his leg, you know, she would have hugged him but the size difference was at conflict here. Then she walked away.

Hannah watched the interaction between the spirits, she had the fleeting thought, perhaps, Amir's personality was contagious.

*Spirits are attracted to similar personalities* - commented in a low tone, just a few steps behind Hannah - *In case you are wondering.*

Hannah didn't reply.

**Are we done here?** - asked the Tiger - **Cuz dis has been confusing.**

*"I am not silly"* - refuted Amir.

*"You are! You should know better"* - argued Sam - *"and for the record, I didn't leap into the portal, it was more like I missed my footing..."*

*"But we don't wear shoes"* - replied Amir.

*"No, I mean my balance was compromised..."* - insisted Sam.

**Gotcha! My uncle had balance troubles as well** - added the Tiger - **Usually after six or seven bottles of ale.**

*"I meant I tripped over and rolled into the portal"* - explained Sam.

**Dats what my uncle use to say too** - added the Tiger mostly ignored by Sam.

*"Oh, I always thought you tried to show off your athletic prowess"* - replied Amir.

***I better intercede this conversation, otherwise the endpoint will continue to drift further away*** - said the Wolf standing behind Sam. The Wolf silver eyes targeted Amir - ***Child! Were you afraid of losing the friendship of this one here***

*"‘This one here’ has a name. It is Sam"* - clarified Sam.

***... yes, right... were you afraid of losing the friendship of Sam if he knew you stalked him, right?*** - continued the Wolf.

*"I didn't stalked him!"* - complained Amir.

***JUST REPLY: YES OR NO*** - said the Wolf losing his patience.

*"Uhhh... ‘Yes or no’?"* - replied Amir following the Wolf's orders to the letter. It was not well received by the Wolf. The survival instincts in Amir kicked in and allowed him to interpret the order - *"I mean, yes! Yes! I was afraid of losing my friend. He is, like a brother to me."*

Sam displayed a big grin on his face and fist bumped Amir - *"You're my bro too."*

***Moving moment, almost felt like my inexistent heart grew a few sizes*** - interrupted the Wolf overflowing with irony - ***With that out of the way, what did you learn child?***

*"Who are you talking to?"* - complained Amir - *"There are three children here, you know? Learning the names every now and then wouldn't harm anybody."*

The Wolf growled, but his anger was contained by the calming hands of the Turtle. The piercing eyes of the Wolf made Amir understand he may have stepped a little out of bounds. He took one deep and calming breath and replied - ***I am talking to you, Amir. What did you learn?***

*"Fears are scary!"* - said Amir. Explaining he didn't think this through would be more than obvious.

A loud \*SNAP\* echoed through the chamber as the Tiger's hand retreated back into his pockets.

*"OUCH! Who would do that wearing rings?"* - complained Amir furiously rubbing the back of his head - *"And let me finish! I think fears can make you freeze on the spot and I could carry them through my entire life without ever dissolving them, but fears are never as bad as I imagine them to be. I guess, fears and worries are like the hairs in our nose."*

In unison, every spectator to Amir's revelation rolled their head to the side, like puppies trying to understand the world.

*"Pardon?"* - asked Hannah.

*"Yeah, you know... you never notice them unless you look. Some play a function in your nose and finally, it would hurt to take them out, but there will be a time when you just need to clench your butt and pull them out, right?"*

The astonished gaze of each spirit crossed each other as the implication of Amir's words resonated within their minds.

The Tiger's wrinkled forehead revealed the intense processing of the idea within his head - **Yeh... I fink dat sounds bout rite.**

***In a twisted way, yes*** - confirmed the Wolf. His thoughts were interrupted Sam's and Hannah's giggles - ***Why are you laughing?***

Hannah had come to understand that some people change as they grow, paradoxically others can grow without ever changing.

The Turtle and the Bat joined chorus of laughing children.

# Silver light

Yule had found a crevice from which she could spy the action unfolding between three pesky children and their evaluators. Meticulously, she positioned herself, wiggling carefully side to side to prevent the unfortunate dislodgement of a reckless peddle giving away her presence.

*"Yeah, you know... you never notice them unless you look. Some play a function in your nose and finally, it would hurt to take them out, but there will be a time when you just need to clench your butt and pull them out, right?"* - listened Yule to Sam's friend; she wondered about the context of such amusing and confusing conversation.

She could see all the spirits burst in laugher, it reminded her about past days when she set her first foot steps on the cave's soft sand. It so frightening at the time, only to find comfort in the cleverness and cheekiness of her companions, the warm embrace of others and the detailed experience of one particular smart kid.

Her memories were somewhat bittersweet. She now knew that careless laugher had a steep price to pay.

The reverberation of the laugher echoing through the chamber had calmed down, replaced by subtle murmurs of conversations happening beyond her hearing capabilities. She leaned forward to increase her chances of peaking into the conversation, enough for her face to poke from the deep shadows as her braided hair, decorated with pink laces, swung gently but unimpeded.

The Turtle had engaged Hannah, with the latter looking noticeably uncomfortable. Chances were the Turtle, being a lover a gossips and rumours, asked Hannah if she had already hold hands or kissed Amir.

She browsed some more the scene playing out below, the Bat and the Tiger praised Amir for his performance in the trial of fire. Well, in pure honestly, Amir praised himself whilst the Bat suspicious stare examined the Tiger.

*Ah, that's a face I haven't seen in a while* - Yule reminisced on the last time she saw the Tiger. They were all dragged to the distant realm of the Tiger, were he made them walk spaces filled with darkness, dragons of smoke and fire, and visions of their future. The memory itself wasn't pleasant, it was the company she had at the time that made the whole experience better. Her sweet smile slowly faded as she recalled the last bearer of the fire blessing.

The trance was broken with the booming voice of the Wolf - ***Children, thy shall gather close to me.***

*"Thy shall do x... thy shall do y... how about a ‘please’ every now and then?"* - protested Hannah.

The Tiger seemed relieved about his decision of evaluating Amir **alone**.

***Thy shall remain silence unless I grant permission to thee*** - snarked the Wolf - ***... Please.***

The tone sent a clear message to Hannah. She wanted to argue, but her judgement advised her not to, and joined the boys around the pillar bathed by the thin stream of light sipping though the cracks.

***What doth thee seeth?*** - added the spectre in his ample wisdom; wisdom that failed to forecast easily distracted children wouldn't be able to understand the context of his words - ***Bid me what doth thee seeth in this location.***

Amir wanted to state the obvious, the first one being the Wolf's way of talking was becoming increasingly difficult to understand. The second point he wanted to mention was his observation of a large vertical rock with four glowing glyphs and the riddle on its side describing some of the trials ahead. He found the analytical gaze of Hannah, studying the monolith in detail and judged it was better to way for her point of view.

Each symbol on the stone shone with the colour of the blessing given to them, or so observed Hannah - *"It is the progress of our journey"* - she beamed after a few seconds, convinced her answer was the most appropriate for the occasion.

The Wolf's immutable expression wasn't much to go by, yet he nodded in return to Hannah's answer. The spectre knew there wasn't much more to do, perhaps it was time for the children to return to the outside world and extend their wings.

*"I think it is so beautiful..."* - mumbled Sam immersed in an hypnotic trance, fixated on something beyond the cave's ceiling. Something beyond the crack on the ceiling from which a bright light shone through, bathing the monolith of the cave with a soft glittering light.

***Pardon?*** - the Wolf followed Sam's gaze, like a spectator would follow the expression of a character breaking the fourth wall of the narrative - ***I am afraid thy art looking in the wrong direction for the stone rests on the ground.***

*"Nah, I don't think I am looking in the wrong direction..."* - Sam was brought back to the current world around him, his gaze floated from Hannah, then Amir and finally, on the Wolf's lupine eyes - *"I think I am starting to understand."*

***Understand?*** - replied the Wolf, suddenly feeling interested on Sam - ***Understand what?***

*"Why wolves howl with such immense dedication at the beautiful moon"* - he answered - *"Its shine filters through the narrow space with its silvery beams. You lose the passage of time, almost as if the sound around you just goes away, leaving that ba-thump, ba-thump. That sound of your flame beating in the stillness of the night, the rhythm of its energy flowing through your body rocking you gently back and forth; like something special is about to happen."*

Yule lips curved up to render a sweet smile, Sam's words didn't seem to be crafted to impressed those attentive and the receiving end, he just let his little flame take control over his tongue, it just flowed from within him.

Sam noticed everything around him had quiet down, perplexed once more with the silver light squeezing itself down to his eyes. The Wolf had joined Sam in his adoration to the simple delicacies in life.

*Having your presence twice in such short period of time. It must mark a special occasion, I would say* - said a voice a little too familiar to Yule's ears.

*"I knew it was a little too suspicious not seeing you down there with the rest"* - she replied to the mysterious shape staring at her with all four pairs of her iridescent black eyes.

*Yet, you failed to sense me coming...* - replied the Spider - *What's trapped your interest?*

*"Sssh"* - replied Yule annoyed at the Spider, she the ability to dig her rhetorical fingers a little too much on her nerves. Yule pointed down to invoke a futile distraction from her own intrusion - *"I want to listen what is going on."*

Almost as on cue, the world below the Spider and Yule had come to a stop, where all the spectators watched the Wolf and Sam mesmerised with the glistening light embracing them. The silence made everything awkward, primarily to Yule who didn't want to turn to face the cheeky grin of the Spider rejoicing out of Yule's embarrassment. 

**Oi, are we staying here doing nuffing or wut?** - The Tiger scratched one ear with the gigantic claw of his.

The interruption snapped the Wolf back into the present, and the present told him that Sam was a strange child indeed - ***I'll need to ask thee one question*** -  he said whilst kneeling next to Sam. He knew the child wasn't listening and decided to make his presence present himself on Sam's present. The Wolf securely grabbed Sam's shoulders and said - ***Why art thee staring at the moon instead of the stone as I asked for?***

*"The stone?"* - replied Sam without losing focus on the silver globe at the distance. Somewhere in his mind he found the necessary energy to stir away from the hypnotic force and turned to face the Wolf and his bright yellow eyes. Somehow the moon light made its eyes beam like a laser cutting through the fabric of space, that is assuming Sam knew what a laser was, but if he didn't know the word, it had to be coined to describe the piercing characteristics of the Wolf's stare.

Sam appeared to be visually conflicted. His brain attempted to land the concepts into words and explain to the wolf eagerly awaiting in from of him, it was obvious by the firm stance of the Wolf's ears. Sam took another glance at the monolith with the symbols glowing in the colours of the flames they had received from each spirit. Sam noticed the pale while stone, reflecting the enchanting glitter of the moon light back at him. His chest stroke once more ‘Ba-Dump’

The silvery light bounced of his retina, found a pathway through the nervous system to his brain and right there, it sliced through his neurones breaking the synapsis of preconceived ideas; reconnecting the unlikelihood of the improbable with a hint of the implausible and the rational of the imaginary. Sam had forgotten the tight but gentle grip on his shoulders, almost as if everything else wasn't real.

Words found a way to his throat and began to form a sentence, they had that indescribable quality, like that fleeting experience when you try creamiest perfectly balanced ice cream for the first time ever, flooding your senses with its sweetness washed away by the present - *"Because the stone isn't calling me, it is what's out there what does, there is something else... I don't know what ‘it’ is."*

Sam felt those lupine eyes drilling deeper, searching for an appropriate answer - *"I just feel it here"* - added Sam covering the little flame swivelling in his chest - *"I mean, the call."*

 The Wolf closed his eyes to savour the words before the present washed it away, but the moment was short lived; he remembered there was a path established for the children - ***Thee shall not follow this calling otherwise the training would be meaningless. Thee shall take the righteous path to Eden.***

Sam's mind remained absent from his surroundings, or so it seemed.

*"How many?"* - he asked.

***How many what?*** - replied the Wolf puzzled by the incomplete statement.

*"How many have you sent down this path?"* - Sam's tone was assertive, his thoughts appeared to be distant, but his hypnotic trance seemed to sharpen his intellect.

***I do not see the relevance of the question.***

*"A path is what remains after someone ventured into a journey. Numerous footsteps had to be taken to erode and mark the path others are meant to follow"* - Sam began his explanation - *"But the path only makes sense if others have been successful, otherwise we are bound to make the same mistakes. So, I want to know... how many have you sent down this path?"*

The Wolf was surprised by Sam's assertiveness, and the only way to answer assertiveness is with the truth - ***Many.***

*"How many have achieved the goal of getting to this place?"* - he followed almost instantly. His gaze still fixated on the distant source of light.

***Zero*** - finally answered the Wolf.

Sam took a breath of fresh air. His thought felt clear - *"In that case, could you be honest with us and tell us what are we meant to find at the end and leave the ‘finding the way’ to us? Not much point of replaying the same script if we already know the answer."*

Sam's words echoed through the chamber. Yule didn't know how to react, as far as she has observed the Wolf isn't the chatty type of spectre.

The words died out and silence took over, interrupted by the sporadic ‘poohink’ of droplets finding a pond of water after taking a leap of faith from a stalactite above.

The Wolf pondered about the child in front of him. He felt odd, his face muscles moved for the first time in a few millennia to draw a soft smile.

**Hey, wut is dat on da face of the Wolf?** - the Tiger's voice boomed through the otherwise silent cavern.

The Wolf slowly turned from staring at the moon, pensive of the past years and the countless children sent to find their destiny at the mercy of the mount afar - ***Ah, this endues backeth memories...***

**Blackest memories?** - repeated the Tiger.

*He just said he remembers the past* - clarified the Turtle.

**Den why not say dat?** - complained the Tiger - **No point talking in a weird way, rite? He always get me cone-fused.**

The Turtle wanted to correct the Tiger, but she let the irony go - *What's in your mind dear Wolf?*

The Wolf cleared his throat, it required dedication to not fall into old habits - ***I remember the days when our lives where blank canvasses, we were ideas without shape, until we filled the role to guide others. We were explorers, then teachers and right until now, we had forgotten a great life lesson: Some people are born to break the mold.***

Sam felt the pressure on his shoulders increase slightly as the bright yellow eyes focused on Sam's pale complexion under the moon light - ***Colour me impressed!***

Amir pulled Hannah's sleeve - *"More or less, what colour is the colour of impression?"*

Hannah rolled her eyes and returned her attention to the pair bathed in moonlight.

***You are right, little young man. We've tried this recipe before and it has never worked. We shall deviate into a different future*** - said the Wolf. There was a hint of pride in his tone.

*"I've never seen him this serious"* - Hannah overheard the Bat's commentary.

The Wolf relaxed his grip from Sam and pushed himself up, looking straight into the the crack from which the light sipped through. He brought his left hand towards his chest and tapped the flame encased in his centre. The flame blazed on in a pure white, almost silvery light, then he extended his hands to welcome something from above. Through the crack on the ceiling, a silver orb began to descend towards the hands of the Wolf, where it floated a few inches from touching him.

Sam could see the Wolf's eyes had changed colours to resemble the orb floating on his hands.



*"What's happening? I don't remember Wolfie doing this when it was our turn."* - asked Yule, watching in expectation the events with the same expression a reader would have if they found out their favourite book had changed its ending.

The Spider uncovered her mouth, she wasn't expecting this result either - *It is hard to explain, but I think Wolf believes your friends might have a real chance of changing everything.*

Yule heard the shaken voice of the Spider, it was strange for the Spider and to anything else which isn't alive to be shaken by the affairs of the living - *"Is everything alright?"*

*I believe you know about the spell casted on these lands to lock the darkness away* - began explaining the Spider - *That same spell locked every single star child away as well. We were fortunate at the time the Wolf casted his own to lock us in here. You are seeing it right there, on his hands.*

Yule stared at the silver orb hovering on the Wolf's hands. It resembled a snow globe, if the snow globe looked like a tiny moon with frosting covering sections of it - *"And he is giving it away to Sam?"*

The Spider nodded.

Yule scanned the room below her. Sam was fixated on the miniature moon, Hannah and Amir mesmerised by the Sam and the Wolf surrounded by sand drifting in the air, glistening as if it was made of shiny metallic bits. Behind them, The Tiger embraced the Turtle whilst watching a moving scene for the first time. The Bat remained seated on the ground, both hands covering her mouth as if the action could hide her shock - *"But if the light goes with them, what will it happen to you?"*

The Spider limited herself to hug Yule, it was a tight hug, the same type you would give to a family member before they embark in a long journey. In a way, it was heartbreaking. Yule wasn't much of a sentimental person, at least she hasn't been for a while now, right until this moment were she found herself wondering if she should break her rule.



***I am sure you have concluded what this orb is*** - said the Wolf, who's coarse voice filled every empty space in the chamber.

*"It looks like a snow globe if I ever have seen o-OUCH!"* - said Amir suddenly jumping on one foot. He looked apprehensively to Hannah's delicate yet incredibly strong feet.

Sam refocused on the Wolf. The orb had this solid appearance hard to ignore, certainly it wasn't like anything else Sam had looked unclose before  - *"It looks like the moon."*

***I wish it was*** - said the Wolf playing with the orb between his fingers. Every subtle movement of his hand had an immediate reaction of the shiny sphere lighting up the room - ***But I hoped your answer to be different.***

*"I know it is your blessing"* - replied Sam still fixated on the silvery object - *"I just don't understand why it is shaped like the moon. It seems to have valleys, hills and patches. It looks frigid and cold yet undeniably beautiful."*

The Wolf smiled once more looking at his beautiful sphere, dancing in between spaces - ***I guess, it is true. It is beautifully charming, maybe delightfully frigid. Regardless, I would like you to have it.***

A Bat spanned out of her shock - *"Wolf, are you sure?"*

The Wolf nodded.

Sam felt thrilled about receiving one blessing more, he extended his arms to reach to the icy silvery orb but stopped on his tracks as his distracted yet proud look gazed at the Bat's apprehensive stare. It was the sort of expression of someone about to give up the most important possession ever.

***Child?*** - the Wolf noticed immediate the change on Sam's expression.

Sam needed to know if the others felt the same, he turned to look at the Tiger who was hugging the Turtle, they too had a melancholic expression.

*"What will happen if I get it?"* - he asked.

***Hopefully the most wonderful end to a story and the beginning of a new one*** - said the Wolf with his now deep silver eyes piercing fearlessly through the darkness. His expression wasn't one of assault or intimidation, it was pure assertiveness - ***You wanted a new path, I am offering you the standing to make that dream come true.***

Sam gave another look at the Bat. It was a silent plead for guidance. She restrained herself to give him a candid smile as she closed the distance between them.

*"It is ok, my friend. I'll see you soon enough. You promised you'll be my friend, don't you forget it!"* - she said it, taking a swing at Sam's arm.

Behind the Bat, Sam could see the Tiger couched next to Amir opening his large arms embracing the small kid - **You gotta remember wut we talked: keep dat flame burning strong. If you feel 'bout to chicken out...**

*"Yes, I know. Face my fears so the blessing doesn't leave me."* - completed Amir.

**Das rite** - replied the Tiger. He looked gigantic wrapping his arms around Amir. He looked even bigger with the Turtle slitted on his shoulders.

Sam followed the Turtle, who jumped off the Tiger's back on an unexpected display of agility, landing cleanly next to Amir. She gave him a tender look and patted his head - *I think this is good enough after the Tiger almost crushed your ribs, huh?*

Amir's big grin was enough confirmation. The turtle then walked towards Hannah as he extended her hand to give her a firm but warm hand shake. Hannah reciprocated the action in a mutual understand of feminine power. The Turtle then said - *You are an adowable littwe one!*

Hannah's expression changed to one of confusion.

The Turtle finally leaned over, close to Sam's ear and whispered - *You are a surprising little fellow. You have achieved the unthinkable.*

*"Receive the blessing of the Wolf?"* - asked Sam.

*Changing his heart. That's not an easy task. Believe me, many have tried!* - clarified the Turtle, giving him a wink before she patted his head as well and leave him to the expecting Wolf.

Sam walked to the Wolf still holding the glowing orb.

The spectre followed him with his proving stare - ***Hidden above us, there is a young lady awaiting for your return. She will take you to the entrance of the cave and the continuation of your journey.***

Sam was surprised by the Wolf's comment and checked over his shoulder.

***I shouldn't have distracted you from the present*** - said the impatient Wolf - ***Either way, you three arrived to this cave, immature, unfocused and unprepared.***

*"I know, but we are going to leave it more mature and ready to take on the challenge"* - added Sam.

***I was about to say you are leaving the cave with our blessings without learning much more. The immature and unfocused part still applies.*** - continued the Wolf with a cheeky tone on his voice. Sam may have seen a little grin of pleasure on the Wolf's face - ***Even with your short comings, you have given me hope, whether you choose to follow a path already made for you, or you build your own; whether you succeed or fail, I am pleased to have met you.***

Sam opened his arms to receive the warm hug of the Wolf.

***I said pleased, not in love.*** - said the Wolf looking at Sam awkwardly lowering his arms. Once again, he opened his hand where the silver orb drifted slowly releasing the fleeting myst as it traveled to Sam, like a bubble about to touch a child.

*I believe this is the part where you go and get your friends out of this cave* - said the Spider to Yule's sorrowful stance.

Yule saw Sam touch the cold surface of the silver orb. It bursted into fine myst which spiralled around Sam. It curved through the air sparkling through, finally finding its way to the centre of his chest, streaming into it like matter falling into a neutron star. When the last bit of it had disappeared, Sam, Amir and Hannah began to glow.

Behind them, Yule noticed the spirits shape become fuzzy and drifting up into the air. She turned immediately to find the Spider staring back at her, quickly vanishing into a myst dissolving into the air - *It was really good to see you once more.*

Yule's little flame once again skipped a beat or two; her chest ached and throat left as if a large stone tried to climb up. She swore never to be weak again, but unfortunately for her, reason is not in charge of emotions. She broke down uncontrollably sobbing as she tasted once more the bitter taste of losing those you care about.

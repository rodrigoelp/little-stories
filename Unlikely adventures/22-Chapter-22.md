Dawn's temple was a building dedicated to the resident elder of this area, the elder known as Father; or it used to be his residence, it has been ages since the elders roamed these realms in their physical form.

The temple's foundations and walls were erected out of pure limestone, brought from afar onto these shores, to give the building that extra ‘oomph’ to marvel those setting foot inside. The scale of the building was nothing short of grandiose, to the distaste of Father, who never understood why which as massive building was dedicated to his frail persona.

The entrance to the temple was equally splendid. Its more than twenty-five metres tall, large and heavily reinforced wooden doors, capped with bronze nails, would keep outside the mightiest of the mantas, the scariest of the dragons and the strongest of the elephants, assuming elephants existed on this world, which they did not. Any visitor would be scared of the temple's contents if the doors were kept closed, which rarely was the case; Father made sure the doors were bolted to the walls so every child, regardless of their age, walked inside to find him with his arms wide open.

In any case, the temple nowadays was completely empty, the laughter of children was gone. All that remained of those days are the marvellous carvings and drawings telling the Father's story.

The lintel above the entrance was beautifully decorated with several shepherding patterns. Curiously enough, high above the lintel, on the cornice of this entrance, a thin red-winged boy laid on his back. He remained there with his eyes closed absorbing the freshness of the wind playfully wrestling with the fibres of his hair.

One would imagine that, in that cathartic state, his mind would be completely blank and totally relaxed; however, he was utterly bored awaiting the call to action.

*"Yo, Mat. What are you doing man?"* - asked Paul from below. His tone of voice suggested the attempt to find a topic of conversation, or at least something to do.

Mathias took a deep breath to ease from his cathartic boredom into a different activity, and without opening his eyes he replied - *"I am mastering the process of osmosis as I eagerly expect the passage of the curved spacetime."*

Paul moved his limps rephrasing Mathias answer then replied - *"Cool man, cool. Would you like to join me catching butterflies or are you going back to your Moses things?"*

Mathias lazily opened his eyes and rolled just enough to watch Paul's innocent gaze looking up - *"Osmosis Paul, osmosis is when whatever it is around you dissolves into you, you consume it just by being close to it. Moses is the bloke we met below the waterfall back in the forest, the one that says he can avoid getting his trousers wet if he tries to cross to the other side of the lake. Plus, didn't we catch all the butterflies around the temple already?"*

*"Yeah but, I was thinking, maybe we should go to the shore, you know? There are plenty of butterflies there!"* - replied Paul suggesting he wanted to do anything to escape his boredom, perhaps, both of them could join their current mood and form the fellowship of the bored.

Mathias sat on the cornice leaving his feet hang of its edge and gestured to Paul to come and sit next to him. Paul flapped his wings effortlessly reaching the edge of the cornice in a single stroke. Mathias didn't react to the impressive feat; he knew that, what Paul lacked in communicative skills he compensated it with physical prowess and charm.

The force of Paul's jump made a mess of his hair, so he pulled a black thread from within his clothes to tide it behind his head in a bun. Now he was able to see Mathias properly and decided it was best to sit next to him - *"I guess that is a ‘Nope’ on the butterflies then..."*

*"Yeah, not in the mood"* - replied Mathias simply - *"Where's your girl?"*

*"Tere is not mine, man. She is a force of nature, she is like the water, you know? If you squeeze her a little bit, she slips through your fingers."* - replied Paul.

Mathias turned to look at Paul with a hint of awe, barely noticeable. Mathias always felt Paul was more complex than he truly showed, maybe he needed to be peeled like an onion - *"Ok, fine. Do you know where is she?"*

*"Dunno, Mat. She told me she was gonna do something and puff! She was gone, you know?"* - replied Paul looking further away from the edge of the temple's grounds at the shore.

Mathias followed the direction of Paul's mesmerised gaze and remained quiet, lost in the beauty of the scenery.

*"What if we go surfing?"* - asked Paul.

*"I told you a million times before, I don't know how."* - replied Mathias.

*"But you have been here next to me, no?"* - replied Paul.

Mathias felt extremely confused at the last question - *"What's the connection between the two?"*

*"Didn't you say you mastered the ossimositis thing? Didn't you learn it from me."* - replied Paul, still fixated on the waves beating the shore faraway.

Mathias turned around with one eyebrow raised and an inquisitive look. He paused a second watching the placid look on Paul's expression and thought - *You really can't judge a book by its cover, can't you?* - then turned around to look at the distance - *"Osmosis Paul, it is osmosis. Ossimositis sounds like an ear infection."*

*"Yeh, you don't want that, you know?"* - replied Paul without thinking too much - *"Anyways, is that a ‘yeah’ to surfing?"*

*"How about we go and talk to Yule?"* - replied Mathias leaning forward in preparation for his descend towards the ground - *"I want to know how long are we going to wait here."*

*"Aren't we waiting for the little dudes?"* - queried Paul.

*"Possibly, maybe. Who knows? She never told me we needed to wait for them, did she?"* - Mathias leaned forward even more and slipped off the cornice with his red wings spread open slowing down his fall. He then, flapped his wings once to hover for an instant above the ground before resting his feet on the grassy area leading to the temple's entrance. He looked up waiting for Paul's answer, but Paul just rolled forward and dropped almost in free fall towards the ground. To Mathias, Paul was a greenish blurred blob accelerating at high speed towards the steps at the entrance of the temple, which just before hitting the ground, opened his wings and stopped his vertical movement in a split second.

Paul walked towards Mathias nonchalantly  - *"Yeh, no worries! I think I saw Yule at the pond, you know? Want me to take you there?"*

Mathias nodded and watched Paul take off like a projectile with a target locked in, it was a perfectly smooth action in which Paul slightly opened his green wings, flapped, again once, and curved his trajectory in an angle towards the back of the temple, as he did all those manoeuvres, he rolled midair to a more comfortable position. No words could better describe it than, an effortlessly choreographed dance in midair.

Mathias shook himself awake and thought to himself - *So glad he is my friend, it must be awful to have to fight with him.*

Then Mathias proceeded to open his wings and took to the air in an attempt to catch up with Paul.

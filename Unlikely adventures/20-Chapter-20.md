# Goatly desires

The sound of thousands of gears flooded the air with its furious spinning as it thundered behind the children whilst the Smith's gate closed shut, Hannah looked into yet another corridor and could not help it but to feel exhausted. The corridors seemed to be never ending.

*"I feel like this is going on forever! Where should we go now?"* - she said staring at yet another bifurcation.

*"Left, we should go to the left."* - said Sam to his frustrated leader.

*"Left..."* - said Hannah leaving the words float in the empty air. She remembered her past interactions with Sam and some of the pieces started to slowly draw a picture in which Sam had been giving her subtle directions. He knew something she didn't. Curiosity invaded every inch of her body, she needed to ask for clarification with a hint of innocence in her voice - *"and why is that Sam?"*

*"Huh... I... The spiders on the walls; it sort of hints where we should go. I think."* - clarified Sam, carefully crafting his words as he realised he might have been discovered in his manipulative game.

Hannah's gaze wondered across the walls with spider decorations spaced every few metres, it all faced in the same direction. She turned and gave Sam the same expression as someone who hates eating vegetables would make when their mom tells them the three bowls of potato chips they ate where kale and eggplant - *"You must be joking, right?"*

He provided a convincing argument by shruging.

She walked back, to the Smith's gate and stared at the walls. The tiny sparse decoration hinted the direction she ought to follow.

She lifted her hand to her face and tightly pinched her nose bridge whilst keeping her eyes closed - *"And you kept this information secret because?"*

Sam felt a little awkward witnessing Hannah's expression. She wasn't upset at him, she just had that sort of expression someone would do after they have turned their home upside down looking for their reading glasses when they have been wearing it all this time.

He shrugged again and gestured with his hands apologetically - *"Technically, I didn't keep it secret. I didn't share it promptly"* - he lied as he didn't want to discourage Hannah any further - *"I realised what it meant just now."*

*"I should've asked you when you stood at the Collector's gate."* - she added, feeling like they had wasted so much time already, partially her fault - *"At least, it will be easier to find the next few gates."*

*"The next few gates? Do you know how many more are ahead?"* - asked Sam intrigued by Hannah's knowledge.

*"Let's see, we went through Father's, the Collector's and the Smith's just now. The next one must be the Twins' followed by the Warrior's and the Wise's. Six in total if there is a gate per each Elder."* - she explained to Sam. His expression revealed a question about to be made - *"Yes Sam?"*

*"How do you know this much about the maze?"* - asked Sam determined to find out as much as he could.

*"Oh! uhm... Well,"* - said Hannah insubstantially - *"Could I explain it later?"*

*"No"* - said Sam firmly.

Hannah's gaze travelled from Sam to Amir's lost-in-thoughts expression. Her face was filled with anguish - *"I... I don't feel ready to tell you. Could we please drop this Sam?"* - she whispered close to Sam.

Sam noticed how Hannah changed her personality from an almost fearless leader to someone pleading for her life - *"I don't know. You seem awfully prepared to take this trial, almost as if you have done it in the past..."*

*"No, I haven't! I swear on the stars and my flame!"* - answered Hannah distressed - *"Besides, you just showed me how lost I've been in the maze! How could I have done it in the past if I get lost all the time?"*

Sam's mind analysed her statement, there was logic in her words but his suspicion wanted to continue questioning her. He opened his mouth once more just to stop shy as Hannah's expression was filled with pain. His curiosity was pushed to the darkest part of his brain; his guilt took over and decided it was best to let things go for now - *"Ok, I'm sorry Hannah. Let's continue. Would you lead the way?"*

Hannah nodded once, still fixated on Amir's oblivious appearance. Amir felt her gaze, waking up from his trance and said - *"Huh? What did I do?"*

A hint of a smile signalled the tension stored in Hannah's body had been released, for now.

*"Nothing, it is all good"* - she replied to Amir's comment - *"Come, let's go this way."* - she broke into a sprint. 

The trio ran down the corridors, following the spidery ornaments as these advised the path on which to travel. In a matter of a few minutes they had found a new gate, or should we say, they found two gates located one next to the other, each decorated with opposing themes.

The gate to their right was decorated with solar allegoric sculptures. A sun beamed light down onto a steep mountain side, the stone stratified lines drew a jagged scenery, slanted towards the left. The side of the mountain glistened with infinite crystals, composing an imagery of snow covered mountainsides.

The gate to their left had a moon casting soft light drew lines as if the moon projected the softest glow on a field covered by the puffiest snow ever. The only theme in common between the two gates were the nine gems trapped in the shape of their respective celestial body. Thin lines connected the gems in the shape of crossed paddles, symbol of the Twin's rivalry. In front of each gate, a gravestone with an inscription laid in plain sight.

*"The Twins"* - commented Hannah as she got closer to the gravestone.

*"Stop competing with others and compete against yourself."* - she read.

*"What does it mean?"* - questioned Sam, decomposing the phrase in his head.

*"Check out the sand on this gate..."* - said Amir slightly touching one of the gates. A loud bang made him jump as both gates swung open revealing a long corridor sandwiched between two massive walls starting and ending on gates, one of which the children were currently using to observe their path ahead.

It would've been an easy walk if it wasn't due to the fact that the ground was missing. Instead, three lines of tiles floated suspended in midair from the gate of the twins, all the way until the end in straight line.

*"(Gulp!)"* - scientifically stated Sam.

*"It just goes straight forward to the next gate"* - observed Hannah.

*"And straight down to the abyss!"* - followed Sam.

*"It will be easy Sam. It should be just like the boulders at the start... oh!"* - argued Hannah as she remembered how Sam nearly gained the perspective of how does the maze looks from below.

Amir remained silent looking at the bobbing tiles, then he said - *"Should we command them to stay put?"*

Hannah considered this for an instant - *It would be prudent to use what we know* - she thought.

*"Please, stay still"* - she phrased.

Nothing happened.

Sam could count at least one hundred tiles between each gate. Well, in reality, he didn't count the tiles; he counted to twenty and just thought that ought to be about a fifth, give it or take, sort of. Nevertheless, it was a long way and each tile would require a long hop to get to the next one.

*"Amir, could you do your thingy?"* - asked Sam expecting a magical solution.

Amir raised an eyebrow whilst turning to look at Sam - *"what thingy are you talking about?"*

*"The sand dance, you know, imagine there is a bridge or something"* - replied Sam.

Amir decided to give it a go, he closed his eyes and focused on a very simple bridge - *"Is it done?"*

Sam and Hannah looked at a pinch of sand dancing on the ground, it hovered a few feet above the ground and stretched above the abyss trying to take the desired shape. Something interrupted the process and the sand plummeted to the void below.

*"Eek!"* - said Sam.

Amir opened his eyes to stared at the bobbing tiles. The tiles looked at him back.

*"Where's the bridge?"* - asked Amir.

*"There"* - added Hannah pointing down. Amir followed the finger into the featureless blackness.

*"Oh!"* - replied Amir feeling a tad powerless - *"Should I try again?"*

Amir closed his eyes, a smaller pinch of sand danced again between his feet and extended into the passage about a metre before the same event happened. The sand seemed to be losing its magical properties after accessing the passage for a few seconds.

Amir opened his eyes just in time to observe the last few grains of sand exploding into a powdery nothingness several metres below them.

All three remained quiet for a while trying to cook a new strategy.

Sam backed a few steps from the edge as he thought - *No point on delaying it.*

*"I'm going first!"* - he said, propelling himself forward at maximum speed.

*"STOP!"* - screamed Hannah making Sam legs to chicken out at the last minute dropping dead on the floor.

She looked at the figure on the floor and said - *"How do we know if the tiles are firm as the boulders back there?"*

Amir grabbed a fist full of sand and chucked it on one of the tiles. The bobbing continued as if nothing had happened.

*"That seems safe..."* - began to reply Amir, but, he was interrupted by a loud crack as the tile fractured into tiny pieces. A few seconds later, it collapsed into the abyss, never to be seen again - *"... as long as we run as fast as possible."*

*"We better be quick"* - said Hannah analytically.

*"(Gulp!!)"* - described Sam accurately - *"Ok, here I go."*

Sam took a deep breath and prepared himself for a long run. He exhaled and fixated his eyes on the dark shape that was the next gate and launched forward. He jumped onto the first tile and the feeling of the tile wasn't too bad, it felt firm and stable, though he didn't want to wait for the tile to break and moved his legs to jump to the next tile. Two, three tiles behind, everything was going great and he heard the loud ‘CRACK’; he jumped to the next one.

*"Keep going!"* - yelled Amir.

Sam had no time to watch behind him, jumped another four, then another ten; behind him tiles continued to make loud cracking noises. He was flying through the corridor, figuratively. By now, he had lost the count of how many tiles he had left behind - *Not too bad* - he thought feeling confidence rushing in his body.

The problem of thinking *‘Oh, I though this would be harder’* is, the creator of the challenge might have a twisted sense of humour and gets you right when you feel safe; this just happened to Sam.

As he reached the centre of the corridor, the walls grew tiny cannons which shot pebbles in Sam's direction, some of them hit him bluntly on his face, others on the back, chest and arms. He tried to dodge the oncoming projectiles, but his progress slowed down.

CRACK! CRACK!

*"What are you doing bud? Run!"* - yelled Amir.

CRACK!

*"Ouch! I'm trying! Ouch! Ouch!"* - replied Sam resuming his hopping from tile to tile.

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

Hannah observed Sam's erratic movement - *"Something is attacking him!"*

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

Sam decided, he needed to continue running despite the ongoing barrage. He covered his face with his hands and thrust forward his stride became precise, landing right in the middle of the next tile. A pebble hit him in the ear, pushing him off balance for an instant, then pushed harder until he was ready to jump on the end of the corridor. The onslaught calmed down almost immediately.

*"Are you alright?"* - said Amir's voice from the distance.

*"Yeah... mangled... but ok."* - replied Sam catching up his breath.

*"What happened?"* - asked inquisitively Hannah.

*"The walls... it shoots stones at you... be careful"* - replied Sam. His tirelessness eased out giving him the opportunity to observe the path he had taken. A row of tiles were missing almost in straight line from the beginning right up to the mid section, from there, the missing path became erratic and undulated as he was trying to avoid the attack. Whoever took the challenge last was going to have a real hard time with entire sections of the path gone.

*"Ok then, I guess it is your turn Amir"* - said Hannah firmly.

*"What? Are you crazy? There are less tiles now and you will need those!"* - pointed out Amir - *"You should go first, I will follow you."*

Hannah looked at Amir. His gallantry made her want to hug him tight and she wanted to apologise for treating him so badly. She opened her mouth but the words didn't come out. She just hugged him instead and said - *"Don't fall or else..."*

*"I know"* - he replied simply.

*"Ok then"* - she said wiping up a tear and turned to face the corridor - *"here I go!"*

Hannah jumped on the last standing tile in the front row and professionally ran in a straight line without a hitch. She was focused on Sam who was encouragingly waiting for her. Her eyes diverted slightly when she noticed some tiles missing ahead of her - *I'm ready!*

The walls had fixed their aim at the new contestant and, with an attitude of gender equality, they opened fire indiscriminately. Hannah felt the first pebble hitting her hard on her thigh making her jerk as he stepped on the new tile. A few steps forward, another one hit her on her knee. She found it frustrating as she was unable to see clearly ahead of her and coordinate her legs. Filled with anger yelled - *"Bloody hell, stop this now!"*

To Sam's and Amir's surprise, the attack seemed to have come to a halt.

The loud cracking sounds made Hannah painfully aware she had no time to rest and she proceeded her run.

The walls were trying to recover from the surprise, they were caught off guard by a girl with such a foul mood and her lack of manners. They didn't have to listen to her and they resumed the attack.

*"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Hey! Give me a break!"* - she yelled trying to find a way to Sam.

*"Keep running!"* - encouragingly yelled Sam.

*"Keep quiet!"* - she yelled back.

*"You are doing great!"* - continued Sam.

*"Shut up or I'll make you shut up!"* - yelled back Hannah recovering from a blow to her left ear.

Sam learnt at that precise moment a valuable lesson. When someone pissed off tells you to shut up, you obey instantly.

The barrage had become heavier, or so Hannah felt, the stones were specifically targeted to her head or her legs. The walls seemed to know where to hit to make her trip. She was getting closer to the end. 

She extended her arms and jumped before stepping on the last row; Sam knew she was going to be a bit shy of reaching out the edge and he stretched himself; reached for her hand and pulled her in.

*"Hey, we are safe!"* - said Sam relieved and ecstatic squeezing a little too hard Hannah's hand.

*"Yeeeaaaaaaaouchss! Thanks Sam!"* - replied Hannah releasing her hand from the enthusiastic bear grip. It was Amir's time now, she got nervous immediately.

Amir felt relieved once Hannah was out of harm's way and without thinking about it twice, he ran towards the few tiles left. Metaphorically speaking, he moved through the challenge as a hot knife cuts through butter: swiftly. Both Hannah and Sam observed Amir jumping from one tile to another and at times stepping on the wall to reach two or three rows ahead when the tiles where completely across the opposite side.

*Definitely, he must have a mountain goat as his ancestors* - thought Sam.

Hannah remained silent but a cheeky smirk had appeared on her face as she observed Amir athletic display. Her mind said - *Maa! Maa!* - perhaps she sent a mental wink or two.

Then Amir reached the most difficult section and pebbles were shot on every direction

*"Ouuf! Agh! Ouch!"* - proclaimed Amir as the bombardment tried to throw him off balance.

*"Come on buddy! You can do it!"* - yelled Sam, though his thoughts were fixed in - *Do not fall, do not fall, do not fall!*

 Hannah was fixated, observing Amir's feats - *Maa maa maaaa!* - said her mind.

Amir continued rushing through, another step on the wall and he spun mid air landing on the opposite side, from which he jumped rolling in the air as he skipped three rows of tiles. One final push got him over the edge on which Hannah and Sam watched totally mesmerised.

A rain of pebbles, leftover from the attack on Amir, shook them up awake from their trance.

*"Blooby bell... I'm babbered"* - said Amir in an attempt of human communication, exhaustion filled every breath he took.

Sam was utterly impressed, Amir raced through the last part almost effortlessly. He could see how strong the attack was on Amir, most of his face was bright red and started to swell.

*"Are you ok?"* - asked Hannah. She held him like a fan would hold a very attractive super star, tightly and closely.

*"Beah, Ab bood. Too bany bebbles"* - complained Amir. His brain caught up with the pain of the last events and the unforgiving dexterity of the walls - *"banks bor basking. Eberybing burts!"* 

Hannah softly touched his cheeks, her heart was beating hard. She wanted to do more than just hug him.

*"Guys, I think this is another gate"* - said Sam who had been inspecting the final section of the corridor.

Amir looked past Hannah's shoulder, a large gate made of black stone stood in front of them. Well, he could say the gate stood there, the hinges were dislodged out of its socket, the gate was in shambles.

Hannah's gaze travelled from Amir to the black gate in front of her - *"The Warrior's gate"* - she added without any other explanation. Her fingers touched the stone, it felt cold and very solid, almost reinforced. She continued inspecting the gate, it looked heavy too. Its stone was polished to perfection, she could see a dark reflection of herself staring back, sculpted in the middle of it a large shield with a lance crossing a sword.

*"What could have done this? It tore it out of its place!"* - asked Sam.

*"Bho knows?"* - said Amir perplexed at the scale of the gate - *"Bhateber it bhus, bhus bhuge!"*

*"You don't want to know"* - said Hannah grimly in reply to Sam's question - *"We should march on, it may not be a good idea to remain here."*

She carefully helped Amir to stand. They all squeezed between the broken gate and advanced into the next challenge.

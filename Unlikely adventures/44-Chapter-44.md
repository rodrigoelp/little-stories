# Twilight

Sam kicked one distracted pebble, dislodging it off the cobbled path towards the bushes surrounding the pond - *"I am telling you, it would have been useful to carry some of those books with us. It would be light reading for the travel."*

*"Several of those observations are absurdly inaccurate my dear Sam. Those books are made out of macaubus quartzite. It could be anything but light reading"* - Virgil struggled to argue with an irrational child behaving like a child without reason - *"And before you argue further, whoever said ‘knowledge weights nothing’ didn't try to lift any of the books back there."*

*"What's Macaubus?"* - Sam needed to get used, once again, to Virgil's presence. Sam wondered if the way to surpass how much you can learn was by not having a brain at all. Virgil always had this universal knowledge hard to explain.

Virgil ignored Sam's question - *"Where is Amir? He has been unusually quiet for the better part of the last ten minutes."*

*"Psst! Guys! I am here!"* - Amir murmured from under the bushes closer to the pond - *"The girls were talking about us, I heard our names!"*

Sam crouched between the branches, trying to find Amir among the thick foliage - *"What are you doing here?"*

*"Ssssh! I want to hear what are they saying!"* - complained Amir, still whispering to avoid revealing his location.

*"Dude, I really think we ought to get out. They will be mad if we are caught earsdropping"* - Sam applied logic and reason to the problem.

*"Eavesdropping"* - corrected Virgil, his spectral figure poking out of the bushes, looking down at the children - *"Unless you are undead, you wouldn't be dropping ears to listen to a conversation"* - Virgil remembered the imagery of a few historical figures discovering this fact through empirical research.

Amir was about to protest, but Virgil interrupted him - *"Consider the idea, the girl may want some privacy."*

Amir opened his mouth to argue, but once again Virgil interrupted him - *"Besides, I believe you have been spotted hiding in the bushes."*

*"Amir?"* - said Hannah's voice, standing on the bench staring straight at the spot Amir laid hidden.

*"Wrong number!"* - he replied - *"The recipient you have tried to reach is unavailable or the number has been disconnected!"*

*"Amir, I can see you"* - said Hannah firmly.

Amir bent slightly forward, whispering to Sam - *"I think to have read that if we don't move the girls can't see us."*

*"That... that can't be true!"* - complained Sam in a whisper, unconsciously following Amir's actions - *"Besides, you couldn't read any of the books!"*

*"Ah, you got me!"*

*"Amir! Are you going to stay there?"* - Hannah's tone sounded tired, tired of dealing with Amir - *"You are making a total mess out of the shrubbery!"*

*"What did I what?"* - he whispered confused onto Sam's ear. Sam didn't like it.

*"Boys?"* - said Yule's calming voice - *"This garden is very dear to me, would you please come on out and join us?"*

Sam stoop up without hesitation like following a divine command and marched - *"Let's go Amir."*

*"Dude! Really? Are you going to betray me? You're revealing my location!"*

*"They already know where we're hiding. Besides, you're getting too close to my ears, and I don't like feeling your breathing on my neck"* - Sam walked slowly and carefully out of the shrubs, avoiding to sudden reaction the very flexible branches of the banksia bush has when disturbed. He would have been completely successful if he would have avoided one particular branch that slapped him in the face with the sweet nectar in its flower.

Amir indignation kept him in utter silence. He didn't like the feeling, specially since Virgil stood right next to him with his piercing eyes drilling through his shoulders - *"Did you see that? He doesn't have any backbone..."*

Virgil watched Sam walk towards the girls, there was no indication to suggest Sam required orthopedic intervention - *"Your espionage session was short lived."*

Amir could feel Hannah's gaze on his neck too. He showed his empty hands, like a magician who has vanished their assistant - *"Alright, I am here!*

*"I know you've been there. Get out and come here!"* - said Hannah a little more irritated than before. She battled those intense feelings of strangling Amir and missing him every second he hasn't been around - *"Come with me, the sun feels great here."*

Hannah's open arms were temptation enough for Amir to drag his feet towards the pond, where Sam stood still next to Yule. He gave a furtive look at Virgil as he left the shrubs behind, whispering - *"You are lucky the girls can't see you."*

*"You have no idea"* - Virgil replied.

*"That reminds me big guy, with the girls around, how can we talk with you? We don't want to look insane talking to ourselves, if you know what I mean."*

Virgil stared at Amir - *"Did you leave the staff were you found it?"*

*"Uhm... I... well... Hey! Don't change the topic!"* - protested Amir starting to sweat profusely.

*"Fine, I'll tell you when to talk to me, and with that topic over, did you leave the staff on the ground as I asked you to do?"*

Virgil's stare could make you sweat bullets without bullets ever been created in this part of the cosmos or multiverse. Amir had experienced it a few times in the past, it felt unpleasant every single time, it was the sort of conversations you have with someone who knows you well enough to give you practical exemplification of rhetorical questioning.

*"Amir! Are you coming or not?!"* - Hannah sounded more than irritated, because the way she phrased it said she wasn't asking, she commanded him to go.

*"I... I gotta go!"* - He apologised without making eye contact to Virgil, nor he wanted to. Amir was determined to leave Virgil's accusatory gaze at all cost, and the cost was a series of grazes, cuts, and a few whips on the kangaroo apples.

*"Are you... all right?"* - Hannah asked concerned as the dwindled Amir emerged from the bushes.

*"Peachy"* - he replied with squeaky voice, squeakier than he would have liked it. It cut right through the manhood he wanted to project, but was crushed by a well located and surprisingly elastic fern branch - *"Never been better."*

*"Hey buddy"* - Sam threw his arm around Amir's shoulders, partially to help him straighten his awkward position, partially to check on him. The reception surprised him, Amir shook his arm off.

*"Traitor"* - he mumbled.

*"Oh, let it go already. They knew we were standing there either way."* - Sam smiled, it was a big warm smile, it made Amir more upset and needing some well deserved space. Sam took a few steps aback and walked towards Yule.

The imagery was almost painted out of a fantasy story, Yule remained seated on the bench, near the pond reflecting the bright blue colour of the sky, with a hint of pink casted by the line flowing from Eden. Sam's stare moved up, focusing on the shadows of the city between the stream of light. He couldn't tell, but it was quite hypnotic.

Amir watched Sam's back, completely immobile. Never before Sam had ignored him, not even when Virgil scolded him - *"Oi, Yule, was it?"*

*"Yes Amir"* - she answered.

Hannah approached Amir and squeezed his hand. It was gentle, but Amir had come to understand the unspoken language from Hannah, this time it said - *"Careful what you are about to say."*

Thoughts rushed to his head, he wanted to ask what sort of spell she had casted on Sam. He opened his mouth and closed it a few times in a row. Clearly his brain and mood were having an argument, trying to decide to smartness of venting his frustration versus how much trouble he was willing to get into, they agreed the best thing to do was to not say anything, but to push Sam out of the way as they needed to be at places; the destination wasn't clear, but the path included Sam as an obstacle.

Amir shouldered Sam out of the way, but there was no reaction from him. Sam remained fixated on the contour of the city floating in the middle of the red streaming light; the world had turned into a far away murmur, nothing more than blurred visions of his friends and distorted sounds, just those buildings remained defined, and drums becoming louder and louder.

Ba-thump.

Sam's focus glued to the red and black contrast.

Ba-Thump.

Almost like the image, the view of that mystical citadel called him.

Ba-THUMP!

Now even the citadel was nothing else than a distant memory, a blurred picture of black and red.

*"..am?"*

BA-THUMP!

The drums were more like heartbeats.

*"..am??"*

BA-THUMP!

Sam's senses had been consumed by the darkness pouring from the citadel. Just the loud heartbeats remained.

BA-THUMP! BA-THUMP! BA-THUMP! BA-THUMP BA-THUMP!

*"Sam!"* - Yule's voice woke Sam up.

*"Uh? What did I miss?"* - Sam's vision slowly focused on whatever, or whoever in front of him.

*"Is he Ok?"* - asked Hannah, or at least her voice, Sam couldn't tell.

*"At least he is waking up"* - said Yule, she sounded a lot closer.

*"I swear, it wasn't my fault!"* - that was Amir. Sam was sure of it.

The neurological pathways reconnected whatever that wasn't working. Everything came in a single go, Sam had been laying on the ground, with Yule's lap as his pillow. Like a spring malfunctioning, releasing all its energy in an instant, Sam sat straight up - *"What just happened?!"*

*"You tell us... You just fainted"* - said Hannah.

*"I... fainted? I just remember the heartbeat."*

Yule gasped, and covered her mouth as quickly as she could.

*"What heartbeat?"* - asked Amir, looking at Mount Eden and the pretty lights - *"Maybe you have synesthesia."*

Hannah felt uncomfortable with the series of events: Sam passed out followed by Amir unusual behaviour.

*"All I am saying is there is certain rhythm to the light, maybe that triggered"* - he added.

Sam rubbed the sides of his head in an attempt to tune and clean a fuzzy image - *"I can't remember, but the citadel, there was something coming out of..."*

*"Stop it!"* - Yule interrupted. She had noticed Sam's meandering gaze, drifting from her face towards the citadel further away - *"I believe nothing good will come out from that memory Sam. Do not look at Eden either."*

*"But I..."*

*"Promise me, you will avoid it."* - Yule's voice had become harsher, Sam noticed.

*"Y... yeah, ok."* - said Sam a little chest-fallen.

*"You know what? I am ready to move on. Do you guys feel up for a quick race?"* - said Yule returning to her usual soft and gentle self.

*"Where to?"* - Amir.

*"A race to..."* - Yule moved her hair back, as if she was listening to an invisible informant. Curiously, a faint breeze revolved a few strands of her hair, Yule just smiled in return - *"Oh? Interesting. We will be racing towards the Collector's archipelago."*

Amir felt annoyed - *"We have no idea where that is."*

*"I do"* - said Hannah to Amir's surprise - *"It might take us a few days from here."*

*"Ok then! The girls lead the boys! Let the best... pair win!"* - Yule smiled extending a welcoming hand towards Sam. He felt blood rushing towards his face, but grabbed her hand without a doubt. She flapped tenderly, the air whooshed in, it helped her to effortlessly float towards a sea of clouds separating the terrace at the top of the temple and the shore further down.

Hannah watched the scene unfold. Very few things have made Hannah feel awe, this was one of them.

*"Pffff!"* - very few sounds can describe disapproval as a good ‘Pff!’, Amir had added an extra ‘ff’ to amplify it.

Hannah felt annoyed at the sound - *"What was that?"*

*"An onomatopoeia... if someone were to read it, that is."*

That's it, Hannah couldn't resist checking Amir's empty hands, she was sure he has been reading Tiger's dictionarium - *"I know what the sound is. I meant, why did you make it?"*

*"Did you see that? He just took off... Just like that! Gone! He chased her like a puppy after his owner!"*

Her right eyebrow raised, a teasing thought forming - *"And that's annoying to you because?"*

*"What do we know about her, really? Think about it, she might be planning to butcher us in our sleep!"*

*"Highly doubt it. She helped us back in the cave. It doesn't fit the grand plan of a master assassin, if you ask me."*

*"Like a puppy wagging his tail, I said!"*

Hannah remembered that odd phrase ‘haters are just confused admirers’, or was it mentally challenged individuals? - *"You know Amir, jealousy is not a good trait."*

*"I am not jealous!"*

*"Sounds like it, though."* - she said picking up a stick off the floor.

*"I am not jealous. He can do whatever he wants to do, he is a silly fool."*

*"Ok dear, if you say so."* - she tossed the stick up and down to Amir's partial amusement.

*"Not even one look, I can barely see their shape from here."*

*"Not even one bit jealous?"*

*"What would I be jealous abo..."*

Before Amir completed the sentence, Hannah threw the stick in the opposite direction to the pond. Amir's eyes followed the object arch through the air, and without any intervention of his brain, his muscles moved effortlessly, hopping to catch the disposed piece of wood.

*"Good boy!"* - said Hannah with a big grin on her face.

He offered the stick back to Hannah, but she prepared her dress for the process of flight - *"I believe we should go now, otherwise those two will beat us to the race."*

She leaped up, into the air following the path Yule had taken, leaving Amir behind - *"Come on darling, come on! Come here good boy, come here."*

Amir felt confused holding the stick, so he tossed it aside and chased her whilst trying to understand why he felt so enthusiastic fetching it. His mind tried to analyse the last series of events, but the simple process was challenged by the urge to open his mouth and let his tongue dangle to the side of his face.

# End of Dawn

Sam kicked one of the loose stones on the cobbled path towards the pond - *"I am telling you, we should have carried some of those books. Some sort of light reading."*

*"Other than you are ignoring the fact the books are made of solid Macaubus quartzite and it be squashed you to death."* - replied Virgil with his usual calmed tone.

*"Macaubus what?"* - Sam needed to get used, once again, to Virgil's presence. He always had this kind of cosmological knowledge trapped in his immaterial mind that was hard to explain.

Virgil didn't even stop to elaborate, he naturally explained - *"The type of rock used on the books. I guess he wanted to write his memoirs and couldn't wait for the invention of paper. By the way, where is Amir? He has been quiet these past few minutes. It usually isn't a good thing when he isn't making a ruckus."*

*"Pssh!"* - called the sound of forced air between Amir's lips - *"Come here!"* - he murmured.

Sam sneaked in the bush, he could hear the girls mumbling something, interrupted by the sporadic laughter - *"What are you doing?"*

*"I think they mentioned our names..."* - whispered Amir.

Sam had never noticed Amir so focused in the past - *"So what? Let's get out of here, I am confident Hannah will not appreciate us ears dropping."*

*"Eavesdropping"* - corrected Virgil, whispering to the children.

Both Sam and Amir looked at each other. Amir asked before Sam opened his mouth - *"What's that?"*

*"The word, it is eavesdropping. You wouldn't be able to secretly listen to a conversation if you drop your ears."* - the mental image of ears dropping off made Virgil remember a few historical figures, perhaps a sunflowers painter, that discovered this truth through empirical research. He resumed his whispering - *"Nevertheless, we shall give privacy to the girls."*

*"Why are you whispering?"* - asked Amir.

*"Yeah... Why? I thought we are the only ones to hear and see you."* - supported Sam.

Virgil walked through the thick bushes around the pond towards a clearing. He didn't say a single word. The boys followed him around, getting their robes tangled with some of the branches.

Virgil remained quiet; one of the virtues of dealing with Sam and Amir was their poor long lasting memory, they would get distracted with the flap of a butterfly or the shininess of a pebble.

Destiny did not agree with him on this opportunity. Sam poked his head out of the bushes getting an unsolicited assistance from Amir who pushed him out of his predicament.

Sam brushed off a few leaves and branches - *"So, what's up with you whispering?"*

*"I guess I was caught in the moment with the two of you muttering around"* - lied Virgil.

*"Perhaps you thought you were alive, my friend"* - Amir.

*"That might be it."*

*"Speaking of looking insane"* - said Sam - *"We need to find a way to talk with each other without the girls noticing. I would appreciate the lack of stares questioning my sanity."*

*"... but should we?"*

*"Should we what?"*

*"Question our sanity?"* - Amir looked mortified - *"Think about it Sam, the two of us are the only ones with the ability to see dead people."*

*"Spirits"* - corrected Virgil.

*"We are certain the girls could see the spirits in the cave, but not out here..."* - Amir.

*"So, Virgil is just an hallucination?"* - Sam.

*"What's that got to do with cheese?"* - Amir.

*"You are thinking about Halloumi"* - corrected Virgil once more - *"Hallucination is the perception of something that isn't there."*

*"Well? Are you?"* - Sam.

*"It wouldn't be an appropriate assessment if an incorporeal entity were to tell you about its own existence"* - Virgil noticed the blank stares of the children - *"No, I am not. I was sent here to guide you, or help you in any way to complete your destined goal."*

*"I don't know about you Amir, but I am feeling a headache coming through trying to break that down."*

*"Yeah, me too."*

Virgil had that tantalising sensation telling him the children had mature in the cave, they were taking some topics with seriousness and maturity - *"Either way, I'll use my judgement to present myself when the time is suitable and appropriate."*

*"How convenient..."* - voiced Amir.

*"Excuse me?"* - Virgil - *"What do you mean with convenient?"*

*"That you will appear when we need it the most to get us unstuck. It feels to me like a cheap plot device."* - protested Amir.

*"Isn't that what guides are meant to do?"* - argued Virgil.

*"I mean, yes. I guess."* - Amir.

*"Then shut up and do as I say"* - said Virgil showing up some of his temper. He couldn't remember the last time his feelings took over his reason - *"Judging by the laughter, your new friend should be ready to take off."*

*"Yes dad!"* - replied Sam.

*"I am not your father!"* - replied Virgil.

*"No! That is not true! That's impossible!"* - Sam.

*"Go on, I don't want to continue this conversation"* - Virgil.

*"Aw... I was hoping for a ‘search your feelings. You know it to be true!’ and I would scream dramatically nooooo!"*

*"I am beginning to question your sanity"* - mumbled Virgil.

*"It was a little story. I read in the library when Amir looked for wizarding books"* - Sam.

*"What was it called?"* - Virgil.

*"Bellic conflict among incandescent celestial bodies"* - Sam.

*"That's certainly catchy"* - Virgil - *"But enough of these shenanigans. Pack your things and leave. There is much to be told, shared and train. For now, I bid farewell."*

*"Sam, who's farewell and what are we bidding?"*

Sam rolled his eyes - *"Why are you leaving?"*

*"Curiosity, dear Sam. Curiosity killed the cat, or so they say. I just find them fascinating."* - Virgil.

Virgil has always found a poetic way of phrasing statements utterly incomprehensible. Sam knew better, Virgil spoke a language that required more than just listening each word dancing with one another. You needed his  impregnable mind.

*"Will you come with us?"* - Sam.

*"In due time..."* - The children watched Virgil disappear in the air.

*"So, what now?"* - said Amir, just in time to hear Hannah's laugher filtering through the foliage. Amir felt his ears stretching in an attempt to travel back in time and snoop the source of their laughter - *"Seriously, what are they laughing about?"*

*"Doesn't matter Amir, come on. We should catch up with them"* - Sam.

*"No! Sam! Come on!"* - Amir begged Sam to stay hidden, but his pleads fell in deaf ears, or rather, selectively deaf ears.

Sam stepped out of the bush into the cobbled path surrounding the pond. The girl waved at him, welcoming him - *"I was suggesting to Hannah we should go looking for the two of you."*

Hannah gave a smirk to Yule. It was the sort of smirk that said ‘but we were afraid we were going to find you’. Sam noticed it, now he regretted his decision, but he was already there - *"It seem you are ready to travel."*

Yule nodded after a moment of self reflection - *"I guess so, I am ready for a journey with new friends and my old ones."*

*"And... where are these old friends we are talking about? Perhaps are you going to introduce your lov-Ouch! What was that for?"* - said Amir rubbing his ribs, watching apprehensively Hannah's retreating elbow.

*"Sorry, honey. I am a little clumsy"* - Hannah's voice had an edge to it. It communicated to Amir the possibility to find a series of uncoordinated elbows finding his ribs if he persisted on the subject, a sort of uncoordinated coordination.

Yule smiled as she extended her hand towards Sam. It was the sort of smile that is warm and inviting - *"Let us depart and make new friends."*

Sam smiled back - *"New friends and an amazing trip to Eden!"*

Sam extended his fingers to hold Yule's hand, but there was nothing to hold onto. Yule had retired her hand, mentioning Eden reminded Yule of the path the children will be taking. She gave another smile to Sam, it wasn't as warmth as the previous one. In fact, Sam noticed a hint of sadness behind it.

*"How about a race to the prairies evergreen fields? I bet you have never seen such beautiful lands..."* - began to comment Yule, when a breeze interrupted her thoughts. It was almost as if the air was an invisible character talking to her, telling her a secret - *"Slight improvement to my plans! Follow me!"*

Yule flapped her wings tenderly, almost as if she wanted to caress the air around her. It seemed to grant her unnatural abilities, she seemed to just float effortlessly towards the clouds - *"Are you guys coming?"*

Amir watched Sam tense up the muscles on his back to propel himself towards the unknown. Sam flapped twice brushing out the grass under his feet, leaving Hannah and Amir behind.

*"Pfff"* - said Amir, appalled at Sam chasing after Yule.

Hannah felt annoyed at the sound - *"What was that?"*

*"An onomatopoeia... if someone were to read it, that is."*

Hannah checked Amir's empty hands, she was sure he has been reading Tiger's dictionarium - *"I know what the sound is. I meant, why did you make it?"*

*"Did you see that? He just... Like that! Gone! He just jumped after her, like a puppy chasing his owner showing him a shiny ball."*

Her right eyebrow raised, an evil thought forming - *"And that's annoying to you because?"*

*"What do we know about her, really? Think about it Hannah, she might be planning to butcher us in our sleep!"*

*"Highly doubt it. Sam told us she helped back in the cave. It doesn't fit the scheme of a master assassin."*

*"Like a puppy wagging his tail, I said!"*

Hannah remembered that odd phrase ‘haters are just confused admirers’, or was it mentally challenged? - *"You know Amir, jealousy is not a good trait."*

*"I am not jealous!"*

*"Are you sure? It seems to be the opposite if you ask me."*

*"I am not jealous of the silly Sam not even turning around to check if we are coming..."*

*"But he knows we are coming, though"*

*"Not even one look, I can barely see their shape from here."*

*"Only bad people are jealous of their friends"*

*"I am not jealous"*

*"Then you must be a good person, wishing him happiness, right?"*

*"That's right, I wish nothing but happiness to that ungrateful block head leaving us behind to chase some random girl..."* - he realised the smirk on Hannah's face - *"I am a good person."*

*"Yes, you are a good boy."*

*"That's right."*

*"Checking one more time, who's the good boy?"*

*"I told you, I am!"*

*"Yes, you are! You are a very good boy. Now, let's catch up with those two before they stray too far from us"* - said Hannah, reaching for the freshness of the nearest cloud - *"Come on boy, come here!"*

Amir jumped up into the air chasing Hannah - *"Coming, I'm coming!"* - It was very hard to figure out way, but despite Hannah's childly tone whilst calling him, he felt enthusiastic and, up to a point, he had to fight the urge to open his mouth and let his tongue dangle on a side of his mouth.

Sam, Virgil and Amir are walking around the pond. Sam doesn't know how to act as he knows Hannah can't see Virgil. Amir wonders why are the girls laughing so much, but Virgil tells him not to interrupt. They walk towards a bushy area on which he tells Virgil how could they communicate as he doesn't want the girls to be afraid.

Amir changes the question to why can't anyone see Virgil. He explains he is a spirit brought down to guide them. Amir says it is quite a convenient plot device. Sam and Virgil ignore the comment. However, Sam tells him he doesn't want to scare away Hannah or Yule. Virgil tells him he will find precise moments when to show himself to guide the children, but once more, usher them to prepare for departure. Virgil disappears trusting the boys will reunite with the girls and start their journey towards Prairie.

The boys do so, exchanging a few laughs with the girls before Amir says something awkward. Hannah knocks the wind out of him to Yule's puzzled eyes and tell Sam and Yule to begin their journey whilst Amir recovers from the massive elbow.

Yule challenges Sam to a race and the two flap away, leaving the temple behind.

Amir asks why did she hit him so hard to which Hannah replies he doesn't know how to read the room. Then she hugs him and follow the two children on the clouds.

# Reminiscence in the dark

The darkness of the void had consumed Sam's body, or at least his will to continue on.

A thump woke Sam up in a familiar but poorly lit room.

The soft sand under the palms of his hands and the tingling feeling on his legs gave him enough clues to realise he was back in the cave before they were sent to the dreamworld.

The memory of the Bat's presence in the room made Sam flinch and jump on his feet quickly, turning to face the last known location fo the Bat in that room. The wall of the cave had the scary sculpture of the creature protruding from the wall, it remained in the same pose before it became alive.

His neurones fired and reconnected the last set of events, refreshing his recollection. It all sprung back to his muscles as he called the names of his friends, his eyes discovered Amir's and Hannah's immobile bodies on the floor.

*"Guys!"* - he said reaching for them. He grabbed Amir's hand, it was stone cold. Sam watched in horror the empty chamber in which Amir's flame should be dancing.

*"Amir! Amir! Come on, wake up!"* - he tried to get an answer from his friend. He started to panic, terrible thoughts began to creep in his mind but he tried to push them away. In the darkness, he reached over to Hannah's body, hers was as cold as Amir's - *"Hannah! Wake up! Amir! What is going on?"*

Sam fell in desperation, his thoughts were turbulent, unable to organise any thought rushing in. He pulled Amir's body closer to Hannah's in an attempt to check both at the same time and feel the difference. They felt solid like stone.

*Light! I need more light!* - he thought groping the floor hoping to find one of the candles until his hands recognised the cylindrical object on the floor. He touched both ends searching for the wick, he fumbled with it a few instants to get it erect then draw it near to his chest hoping his flame would light it up. A spark jumped from his chest onto the wick; the flame slowly grew from a minuscule blue fire to an amber flame crowing the candle, it casted a soft orange radiance to its surroundings.

Sam ignored the Bat hanging off the wall, he observed his friends, motionless, colourless, unresponsive; the entire scene was surreal.

*"Come on!, Wake up now!"* - he said shaking Amir back and forth but it was futile, Sam's despair had turned into hopelessness; he broke down and cried.

Sam gently released Amir's body on the floor, when he observed dark bruises around Amir's neck. Sam recalled the obnoxious memory from the trial, the moment the 'echo' of the Bat dropped Amir from the deadly grip.

The memory continued to images of Hannah getting stabbed by her version of the Bat. Sam wiped his tears-filled-eyes and there he saw Hannah's body, four holes on her abdomen revealed her fate. Sam's vision got clouded once more by tears pouring uncontrollably. He stood up and began hitting the statue with his closed fist, screaming - *"Take me back! Let me finish the trial! Take me back!"*

A soft voice behind Sam said - *"That won't work. **That thing** doesn't give second chances."*

Sam turned immediately, spooked by the voice behind him. The lit part of the room appeared empty.

*"Who's there?"* - he asked wiping the tears off his eyes as he grew cautious of the shadows. A little girl emerged from the darkness beyond the reach of the candle light.

She wore torn down dirty rags, her hair was long frail and somewhat mucky. She looked younger than Sam, but her figure revealed she may have been deprived of a good meal for years; her cheekbones were the most prominent feature of her face as her skin was tightly wrapped around her bones. What was left of her garments were three sizes too big, but Sam could tell she was the same height as Hannah. Sam tried to describe the newcomer and her skeletal appearance but she was easier to compare her to Hannah: he always considered Hannah someone slender and fit, but the girl in front of him made her look like Hannah had some serious weight issues.

*"Who... who are you?"* - he asked whilst deviating his gaze somewhere else, he didn't want to stare for too long; plus it felt uncomfortable to look at her and her abundant lack of muscles.

*"I'm Fladde... hums... my name might be complicated to pronounce, just call me Moss. That's what my friends used to call me."* - she replied shyly - *"And you?"*

Sam wanted to be polite, but he quickly crouched next to his friends bodies - *"I need some help here, please! My friends are..."* - Sam couldn't finish the phrase, his voice cracked with stress watching the petrified bodies. He felt he was rude for not introducing himself to the newcomer but he couldn't speak.

*"I can see, they have been the latest victims of **that monster**."* - interrupted Moss watching Sam's eyes overflowing with tears - *"I'm sorry. I should have been more tactful."*

Moss slowly took a few steps closer to Sam, moving her slim arm as if she wanted to touch Sam's back, she restrained from doing so and added - *"I'm sorry for your loss."*

Sam shook off the tears with anger - *"I haven't lost anything! I will save my friends!"* - but the expression was soon washed away as pain flowed once again, it took the strength from his legs and he collapsed on the ground. Moss watched him grieve.

She crouched next to Sam and continued - *"You should take a deep breath. It can be overwhelming but..."*

*"But what? What would you know?"* - snapped Sam between sobs.

*"... I understand a little too well. **That thing** took my friends too and imprisoned me here."* - said Moss. She remained in an awkward pose next to Sam as if she wanted to give him a hug and comfort him, but she didn't know him that well.

Sam's sobs slowly came to a halt, his face buried in his arms. His voice managed to escape the confinement of his arms - *"How long?"*

Moss was gladly surprised by Sam's voice - *"Pardon?"*

*"How long?"* - asked Sam again - *"How long have you been here? How long since she took your friends?"*

Moss drew her bony hands closer to her cheek, considering the passage of time and the sporadic spacetime ripple, then she shrugged before reaching an answer - *"I honestly can't remember Sam. I've seen so many come and go... or never exit the trial at all."* - She inspected Sam's posture, checking if he decided to join in a more active role - *"I do not have a clue. It is hard to perceive time when everything is so dark."*

Moss stood up, thinking about her recent answer - *"What's the point of knowing, either way? They are gone."*

Sam remained quiet, deconstructing Moss' answer - *"Why didn't you leave? I mean, you could have left and moved on with your life. Why stay?"*

Moss hesitated to provide an answer back to Sam, finally she decided to come cleanish - *"I guess you haven't noticed. The entrance is gone... I did say I was imprisoned here by **that thing**."*

Sam raised his head and looked in the direction he came in to the cave, it was in total darkness, impossible to figure out if Moss' comments were true - *"The entrance was there. I am sure of it."*

*"Be my guest then. That wasn't a lie, you can go and check it yourself."* - she replied a tad annoyed at Sam's disbelief.

Sam wiped his tears, gave a sceptical look at Moss whilst standing up and walking towards the location he knew as the entrance. Sam was consumed by the darkness, followed by the sounds of his hands rubbing against the porous walls - *"it... it can't be. We just walked in here!"*

Moss didn't reply to Sam's comment.

*"It must have moved!"* - said Sam, running his hands further against the wall in an attempt to find a clue embedded on the wall.

*"There is no way out. Trust me."* - replied Moss - *"Right now we are like ghosts, trapped in a space the living can't see but not quite dead. We are trapped in limbo."*

Sam's face pierced the darkness as he stepped back into an area the candlelight reached with enough strength. Anxiety stirred his thoughts.

*"I know what you are about to ask: How do we get out then?"* - she added rhetorically. Sam looked at her with frightful eyes and nodded.

*"I would have told you already if there is a way out. That's why I am trapped here."* - She continued.

*"Then we must go back and finish the challenge!"* - said Sam in a convincing tone, though the tone was intended to be self affirmation.

*"Go back where? To the world of **that thing**?"* - replied Moss with a voice filled with resentment - *"Ha! You are insane. **That thing** is pure evil, just wants to make us suffer."* 

Sam thought about Moss' words, then he saw Hannah's and Amir's body, peacefully still in time - *"I've got to try it, I can't leave them like this."*

Moss gave an incredulous look to Sam and proceeded to stand up - *"You like to overthink things Sam. I told you already, your friends are gone, **that thing** took them."*

Sam's thoughts and gaze froze, fixated on nothing in specific for a few moments, his brain retraced the last phrases as if he was reading the dialogue, sniffing clues in an attempt to create an action plan. His neurones fired, the imaginary contraption coalesced into a statement. His eyes set on the thin companion of his eternal prison - *"You like to refer to the spirit as 'that thing'... you must really hate her, huh?"*

Moss' expression changed slightly, again it was an incredulous look targeted at Sam - *"Don't you hate **that thing** for taking the life of your friends?"*

*"Perhaps I should, yes"* - calmly replied Sam - *"But she hasn't taken the life of my friends... not yet."* 

Moss' annoyance grew considerably, showing she didn't appreciated Sam's optimistic reluctance - *"Stubbornness and stupidity are twins. Consider you are in a dark room without an exit, no way to communicate to anyone else. You are trapped by **that monster**, without your friends. It is hopeless Sam, just give up."*

*"She could have killed me, right there and then, but she didn't. She must be waiting for me to learn from my mistake, right?"* - replied Sam.

Moss' jaw dropped in disbelief - *"You just ignored everything that is around you. **That thing** threw you here! Look at your friends! Get rid of that silly hope, it will get you killed."*

*"I won't do that. I'll find a way out. I just need to think."* - said Sam.

*"Think your way out... Think all you want and then think so more, huh?"* - remarked Moss irritated at Sam's persistence.

*"Yes, I've been told I lack certain lightness"* - replied Sam.

*"And yet, you persevere on your ways."* - mind-absently said Moss, her gaze roamed around the dark spaces in the room. Silence reached every corner whilst Moss fought the urge to understand Sam's wishes - *"Ok Sam, I want to hear it... What's your big plan? How do you plan to go back to the realm of the living?"*

*"I guess, I'll have to talk to her. Request a second chance."* - said Sam briefly.

*"Seriously? Is that it? You are hoping to talk to **that thing on the wall** and ask for another go at it? You'll plead for your life to **that thing**"* - said Moss in a mocking tone. Once she finished, she realised her uncomfortable feeling came from Sam's drilling stare.

*"No"* - he added - *"I won't plead for my life. I want to know the things I've done wrong and how I can be better. I may have been a little judgemental."*

Moss tried to maintain her eyes on Sam but his stare was too intense - *"Sam, You are hopeless. What makes you think **that thing** would listen?"*

*"I think she has, all this time."* - replied Sam without releasing Moss from the intense gaze.

Moss uneasiness was about to hit her limits - *"Stop it already! Has nobody told you that it is impolite to stare at a lady?"*

*"Then... give me another chance."* - said Sam - *"Please. You wouldn't have brought me here if you wouldn't consider a second chance."*

Moss shifted her weight from one foot to the other, she dragged her hair out of the way of her ears to listen clearly to Sam - *"What are you saying?"*

Sam smiled as he got the confirmation he needed - *"You are the Bat, aren't you?"*

The girl gave an appalled look at Sam - *"**That thing**? Me?"*

Sam took two steps forward towards Moss - *"You are not ‘a thing’ and I ask you to forgive me for my rudeness in the past. But it makes sense to me now. You must be the Bat."*

Moss' face looked paler than ever - *"That is nonsense!"*

*"You knew what happened to my friends without even taking a look"* - said Sam.

*"So what? I know this trial consumes the spirit of those venturing in! The body of your friends on the floor is a dead give away."* - Moss replied defensively.

*"If she consumes so many, where are the bodies?"* - debated Sam.

*"I... uhms... they decay over time, or maybe they get consumed by the ether, or stored somewhere else!"* - argued Moss.

*"How did you know my name?"* - asked Sam firmly.

*"Huh?"* - replied Moss backing away from Sam firmly approaching to her - *"What do you mean how I knew your name? You... You must have said it."*

*"I didn't. You introduced yourself and I asked for your help. I thought I was rude for not telling you my name but you knew it already."* - Sam took a few steps closer to the fragile girl that was now cornered against Sam and the wall, just under the sculpture of the Bat.

*"You are insane!"* - frightfully replied Moss watching Sam getting closer - *"Stay away!"*

*"And you have been trying to make me surrender and give up"* - continued Sam building his case - *"Over and over, you have been telling me to let my friends go, to stop fighting because it is pointless..."* - Sam took a few steps further, he was at an arm length of Moss.

*"I was just trying to help!"* - replied Moss instinctively. 

*"The trial only had the spirit, Hannah, Amir and myself. Same number of people in here. How do you explain that coincidence?"* - queried Sam.

*"You are absolutely deranged thinking about all this nonsense! Why are you doing this?"* - said Moss almost squirming.

*"I guess I lack the lightness of thoughts as you put it..."* - Sam finally took a deep breath and leaned forward and hugged Moss. The action took her by surprise, she tried to withdraw herself from the embrace but Sam's grip was too tight to escape. He said - *"Would you forgive me?"*

Moss looked at Sam like anybody would watch a person approach them saying: ‘we would love to tell you about the blessing of our lord Om if you have a few moments. Two to three hours will suffice!’

Sam remained with the gentle but firm grip - *"Is there anything to forgive?"*

*"Yes, I judged you based on the appearance of the sculpture when in reality you are someone starving for companionship, am I right?"* - replied Sam without changing his expression.

Moss turned fully to dedicate her attention to Sam who displayed all his vulnerable side to her. The corner of Moss' mouth drew an almost imperceptible smile - *"Don't we all wish for companionship?"*

*"I guess you are right, we all need at least a friend"* - replied Sam - *"I'll be yours. I promise."*

*"Would you be as good of a friend as you've been to these two?"* - replied Moss. Her pose had become softer and more caring for Sam.

*"I'll try!"* - he replied. 

*"It is hard to decline that offer"* - said Moss in return. She extended her arm towards the statue to dislodged the mask. In a swift motion, she placed it on her face - *"We have a deal!"*

Sam felt a gently breeze surrounding him, almost as if the air gave him the softest of hugs he has ever experienced. Not that Sam had experienced many in the past.

Sam watched the slender girl wearing the Bat's mask, pull it above her hair to reveal her face. Her complexion had changed once more, as if she had received good nourishment - *"Letting go of preconceptions is the key of this test. Resentments and prejudice weight us down. I feel you are wiser by the minute."*

Moss waved her hands towards the immobile bodies of Hannah and Amir. Both disappeared with a ‘poof!’ As these collapsed onto two small mounds of sand.

Sam looked in apprehension - *"Are they going to be alright?"*

*"Who? Your friends? Oh yes, they were never truly here nor in the test"* - said Moss - *"It was just for you."*

*"Uh? What do you mean not in the test?"* - said Sam - *"I saw them... Hannah... Amir..."*

*"Ah! It was all a mirage in your mind my little Sam. The very first moment you locked eyes on me I casted an illusion on you. You fell on this dreamland since then. It was all your imagination."* - said Moss.

*"But I saw you in the cave!"* - he replied.

*"Exactly."*

Sam wanted to understand Moss' explanation - *It was all a dream* - he thought still trying to process Moss' words.

*"Sam, my friendship comes with one condition..."* - added Moss. Sam withdrew himself from his thoughts and nodded, letting her know he listened - *"I'll give you a little bit of my heart, will you take care of it?"* - Moss drew her hands closer to her chest, there a lime coloured flame flared up. She then extended her hands offering it to Sam.

*"Is that the light of the trial?"* - asked Sam.

*"Yes, with this you will return to your friends."* - replied Moss with a big smile.

*"... But I said I promised to be your friend. What will you do?"* - he wondered.

*"You'll take some of me with you. Wherever you go, if you need a reminder to leave prejudice aside, I'll be with you to help you and guide you."* - said Moss leaving the flame on Sam's hands.

Sam hesitated for a moment before taking the flame. Though he wanted to return to Hannah and Amir, he felt compelled to give another big hug to Moss - *"Thank you. I'll take good care of this, of it, of you!"*

Moss smiled and extended her slender arms around Sam - "You better go, if you don't wake up Amir might smooch you."

"What? What do you mean with smooch me?" - replied Sam.

"I think he is trying to revive you and he thinks someone told him he needed to push your chest and kiss you for a little bit" - replied Moss.

Sam hurried to merge the lime flame with the one in his chest, sparks from his flame started dancing with the lime flame, slowly blending into a single one. He felt sleepy, or perhaps it was that sluggish sensation just before you wake up from an intense dream - "Hey Moss... before I wake up... could you tell me your full name? Do you remember it?"

"My name?" - she wondered and started laughing - "Well... My name here is Fladdermöss which means the flying mouse!"

Sam drifted towards the darkness of a good dream with the echoes of a giggling girl, laughing at the coincidences in life.

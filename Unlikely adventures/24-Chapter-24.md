# Dawn's pond

Behind the temple, hidden from the view of most of the spectators, Father built a large pond to entertain some of his late years. The pond had a pair of white stone benches from which to admire the tranquil waters and the large collection of water lilies which remained open all year around. Below the surface, a shoal of fish resided the crevices in the rock at the edges of their world, the narrow passages between the roots of the water lilies and some seaweed and a little pink castle next to a miniature of a volcano at the bottom of the lake. Father placed it there out of a joke. Nobody in the realm every understood it with the exception of a golden fish Father brought from far away.

Most visitors to the pond used to watch the waters from afar out of respect to Father's love to his sacred area. However, in this occasion, there was a little girl with braided hair over her shoulders and pink wings decorated with red laces and long red feathers sitting at the edge of the pond. She had her head leaned back and her eyes closed, getting soaked in the never-ending morning sunshine. Her feet were submerged in the pond as the lilies swayed rhythmically with the ripples bouncing back and forth. In fact, every single lily had found a resting place near the edge of the pond.

The wind spiralled gracefully around Yule's ear, curving delicately the edges of her hair. She opened her eyes and filled her lungs with the sweet smell of the flowers around her, which remained strong despite each flower being withdrawn into its bulb shape.

*"I like this. Sitting out under the sun, the fish playing with my toes as I splash a little bit here and there"* - she said.

*"Some things never change then. You have always liked the hidden music of the realms"* - replied Virgil hovering above the centre of the pond. He looked down towards the water and the end of his robe - *"I know I could get my feet wet. If only the water would allow me to touch it."*

*"Well, you are a scary figure"* - replied Yule - *"I guess the water can see through your disguise."*

Virgil remained silent looking at the fish swimming below his spectral figure.

*"I think it was nice chatting with you my friend"* - she said mindlessly feeling the wind play once more with her hair. She closed her eyes and softly hummed to the tune the air sang to her.

*"Yes, it was a good talk."* - replied Virgil turning away from Yule, his shape disappeared out into the thin air - *"And I shall take my leave. Your companions are coming."*

*"Before you go... What are your plans with the three moths?"* - she asked delicately.

*"Three moths?"* - asked Virgil's voice.

*"The two boys and the girl"* - said Yule. A memory was brought forward to her present - *"Ah, what do you want with the two boys?"*

*"I am their guide"* - replied Virgil's voice simply.

*"A guide you say... Are you preparing them to go there?"* - asked Yule. Her figure remained in the same stance as she bathed with the sunshine rays.

Virgil remained silent.

*"Ah, I see."* - she stated - *"In that case, do not let me detain you."*

After a few moments, Yule continued humming to the tune of the wind on her ears as the wind playfully continued caressing her hair, like a mother would to her daughter. Little particles of pollen travelled from the pond, carrying the sweet smell of the flowers. All the lilies had opened their petals to release its moisture and aroma to their surrounding. It was a clear sign to Yule that Virgil was gone.

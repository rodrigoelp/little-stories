# Expectators

The sun knowingly someone had to look up the definition on a math book, looked from an acute position the three creatures walking around the dunes. More specifically, saw Virgil getting frustrated with a pair of kids who did not want to listen and continued running tangentially to their expected trajectory. The sun is such a nerd.

*"Oh, divine flame! why is there so much sand?"* - complained Amir whilst rolling down the dune. Irony wasn't one of his strong suits.

*"You could stop rolling and it would be less annoying"* - openly stated Virgil waving in an explanatory way to just the air.

*"But this is super fun! You see the world go round and round and round..."* - said Sam rolling down another dune perfectly mimicking a tumbleweed that is rolling on a beach... minus the water of course because they were walking deep on the dunes.

*"I don't like it... It's coarse, rough and irritating... and it gets everyw..."* - said Amir breaking a leaf with his hands but Virgil interrupted.
*"Please, don't finish that phrase... might be copyrighted"* - said Virgil rubbing his eyes trying to forget a bad memory.

*"Uh? What do you mean?"* - said Amir with a puzzled look.

*"I mean we need to get to the cave guys. It is time for us to continue the journey ahead. There are trials you need to take"* - answered Virgil in an attempt to explain to the water why it shouldn't slip through his fingers. Surprisingly, it worked. Both kids bolted up and sat cross-legged looking straight at his semi-translucent face.

He looked down and they waited in perfect silence - *"Do you guys want to do the trials?"*

*"Yes, yes!"* - replied the children both in unison - *"it sounds really fun!"*

*"And you will be attentive to my directions and listen?"* - continued Virgil... once he had finished voicing the statement he thought - of course, they are not going to listen. I've been trying for a week to get them to sit still for 5 minutes...

*"We'll do our best!"* - replied the children, again in unison.

... not to mention they will forget this conversation before I - continued Virgil in his thoughts, only interrupted by the silence bouncing in his paranormal and metaphysical mind - *"... what did you say?"*

*"We are waiting for your instructions!"* - said Amir obediently - *"I don't know what trials are but it sounds exciting!"*

Virgil perfect stare, with his bright deep blue eyes, followed an arc from Amir's face to Sam's. If both of them were puppies, they would be making big eyes and wagging their tails whilst waiting for a treat - *"but I am not sure if you are ready for it..."* - he teased - *"... you need discipline and patience..."*

*"Yes, yes, but what are the trials? ... Oh, yes... Sorry... Patience; I am full of it. I am the most patienceter person you will ever know mister!"* - Amir swung his arm with a little smirk trying to be convincing whilst briefly understanding the fleeting definition of irony.

*"... and you need to listen when I explain things."* - continued Virgil. He looked at Sam - *"You've been awfully quiet"*

*"Yes sir! I am listening sir!"* - stated Sam firmly.

*"Good attitude, but this is not the army"* - said Virgil dismissively.

*"Ok, sir! I won't be that formal sir... boy... you"* - said Sam, obediently.

*"Virgil, it's Virgil... we went through this... Just call me Virgil, ok?"* - Virgil felt the afterlife should've been different; at least this afterlife.

*"Right-o, given I have your attention, we need to walk across the dunes into the cave of prophecies... it was a place created by the elders to judge the children and give them helpful abilities."* - he paused checking if their attention continued as firm as jelly, it was rock hard - *"the challenges are hard and I won't be able to guide you in there, only those descendants of the light can go in"*

*"Sounds dangerous... nnnnice!"* - completed Amir, clenching his fist as he pouted with thrill. Sam, on the other hand, looked focused.

*"Shall we go then? We might need to find and pick a few more stars along the way..."* - said Virgil as he vanished.

*"... Amir... what happened?"* - said Sam inquisitively searching for the third member of their party. Amir stood there with his mouth open - *"He poofed away..."* As he moved a rock sitting on the sand, just in case Virgil had been squashed by a theological constant newly discovered in quantum physics.

*"Boys? Are you coming?"* - said Virgil from a far distance away - *"I don't need to walk but you do! Get going!"*

Sam and Amir gave a cheeky smile, they had gained the implicit understanding of challenging each other without having to say a single word and with a swift flap both children took off to the sky following the intangible presence of their mentor.

<br />

From a hill away, four children observed the young travellers gushing through the air - *"New moths have arrived"* - said a tall boy with a green pair of wings.

*"They seem to be heading to the cave of prophecies"* - replied a girl with dreadlocks and a black wings - *"Do you think they will make it?"*

*"I don't know, they seem too... inexperienced... the trials could drive them crazy"* - said a red-winged boy, fiddling with rocks between his fingers - *"Should we warn them, Yule?"*

Sitting near the edge, a small girl with a red bow at the top of her braided hair observed the scene - *"Let's just watch for now. They seem to be in good company..."*

*"Are they travelling with someone else?"* - queried the red-winged boy. 

*"I don't think so..."* - assessed the black-winged girl squinting to sharpen her sight. Her dreadlocks waving with the breeze.

*"... Yule... don't be weird, ok?..."* - said frightenedly the green-winged boy - *"You creep me out when you talk like that..."*

<br />

Yule remained silent, placidly watching from the distance the boys twirling mid-air.

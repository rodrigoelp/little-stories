# Suspire

Sam felt gravity pushing his body gently against the sand below it. His brain reconnected with the nerves of his extremities, removing the foreign sensation from the present, then it brought the memory forward that this has happened a few times already as he consciousness navigated from the deepest parts of the immaterial to the mundane physicality of the world.

A warm puff of air, barely perceptible,  caressed the skin on his face. It communicated the urgency that  Sam had to regain his senses fast, so he began opening his eyes, getting used to the soft light filling up the room. His pupils captured a world out of focus, his brain ordered a sharper image of whatever it was in front of Sam, so the pupils worked swiftly to lock onto the oncoming figure a few inches of Sam's face. The image became clear, it was Amir's face closing in towards Sam, with his eyes tightly shut, and his lips pouting in preparation to make contact with his lips.

*"What the hell are you doing?"* - wondered Sam whilst Amir's face as far as possible. Amir was incredibly strong and the floor fought against Sam.

Amir opened his eyes and his expression changed to pure relief - *"Sam! You are **alive**!"* - he said, half crushing half hugging Sam. It was a long hug squeezing Sam's lungs a little too hard.

*"I... can't.... breathe! My ribs... my... ribs."* - said Sam. Though, it was more an asphyxiated yelp for help than anything else.

Hannah ram against Amir's back to push him off the way of Sam - *"Amir! Let him go! If he wasn't dead before, he might be wishing he was!"*

Hannah's action made Amir recall the last few events, he felt the need to explain himself - *"Erm... hums... About that kiss... it was her idea!"*

*"Nah-uh!"* - reacted Hannah immediately - *"All I said was that, if Sam were a girl he would be surrounded by a tall young man without the sense of personal space and at least seven very short ones called Floopy, Lumpy, Yeasty, Funky, Cheesy and Ramon... or something along those lines. Then you asked me what I meant and I explained that just because a girl who slept too deep after she ate too much shouldn't be assaulted by a prick who wants to lick her face!"*

Hannah gave a look to Sam, she was slightly blushed - *"I didn't tell him to kiss you."*

*"Yea-uh! You did!"* - added Amir - *"You said: one of us might need to help him breathe... like mouth to mouth thing, you know?"*

*"I didn't mean you!"* - said Hannah.

*"Well... huh... I love my friend but I was **NOT** going to let you kiss him!"* - argued Amir - *"What am I? Painted on the wall?"*

*"I am sure you had your motives but, could you... please, not yell"* - Sam felt his head was about to explode with so much shouting in addition to the pain of his ribcage.

*"I did what I did to save him!"* - continued Amir in heated discussion with Hannah.

*"He is my friend too! I would have done it if you wouldn't have jumped on him!"* - Hannah continued the argument - *"Almost as if you wanted to take advantage of the situation!"*

*"I did not jump on him!"* - said Amir shocked at Hannah's implication.

*"Fladdermöss, could you take me with you?"* - said Sam, hoping the statue reanimated itself, extending her wings around Sam, driving him back into the land of the dreams.

Amir's argument got halted in mid air - *"Flan and mousse? What do you mean with Flan and Mousse?"*

Sam smiled to himself - *"Fladdermöss, that's the name of this sprit"* - he added. From his location, the statue looked a lot less menacing than before, the fearfulness it projected was gone. Sam observed the sculpture protruding off the wall was a slender young woman waring an oversized cape with padder shoulders. The cape still gave the same leathery impression as before but, the proportions accommodated a more human figure than before. Sam watched the mask once again, it certainly had features difficult to love; however he smiled and extended his hand to touch it.

*"Sam? What are you doing?"* - said Hannah - *"I wouldn't do that, the last time when you got close to the statue you fainted."*

*"Did I?"* - said Sam half-mindedly. His memories were quite fresh. He could see in the darkest sections of his imagination the statue moving, jumping from one to the other, disappearing under the cape - *"I can't remember what happened when we came in."*

*"Are you serious? Can't you remember Hannah and I walking in, picking up the two candles and lighting it up?"* - said Amir - *"As soon as the statue was illuminated you walked straight to it and passed out."*

Sam remained quiet, he remembered the last conversation with Fladdermöss - *It was all a dream, even before I came in the room. There was no attack, she took me in as soon as I saw her.* - Sam gathered his hands close to his chest, a warmth sensation poured from it, as if a cup of hot soup has been placed on his hands in a really cold day. A glimmer made him look down, just to find a lime coloured flame.

*"Woooah!"* - said Amir scratching his head - *"How? How did you do that?"*

*"She gave it to me"* - replied Sam looking at the statue - *"It is the light of the trial."*

*"Interesting"* - said Hannah as she connected the few clues Sam had given out - *"Does that means we don't need to do the trial anymore?"* - she asked impulsively as questions filled her mind with doubts - *"Wait... The spirit picked you? Why?"*

*"What do you mean why?"* - replied Sam - *"The important part is we have the light, no?"*

*"But I thought each trial is meant to test all of us!"* - answered Hannah filling unease with the current events.

*"I see, you like to overthink as well, huh?"* - said a voice behind the children.

Sam recognised the female and delicate voice. The child form of Fladdermöss stood under her statue. She casted soft light around her, her mask over the top of her head showing her face - *"You should probably head on to the next trial."*

Hannah watched her, her mind scrambled to reorganise her thoughts - *"is she The Bat?"*

*"Yeah, she is the spirit guarding this trial."* - briefly replied Sam.

*"But I thought, the spirits could only show themselves in their worlds or around the pillar outside?"* - followed up Hannah, in an attempt to understand the current state of the events.

*"Ha!"* - reacted Fladdermöss with the same tone someone would use to explain how wrong you are - *"Are there rules written somewhere that we should follow? No little girl, we are free to roam everywhere in the cave of prophecies."*

Hannah continued to examine the spirit in front of her - *"But the statue... you look very different!"*

Fladdermöss gave a gentle look at Hannah whilst slowly approaching Sam - *"Should I examine her as well?"*

Sam shook his head.

*"Very well then"* - She whispered to Sam - *"You have learnt your lesson."* - and winked at Sam. He didn't reply, he focused on the warmth the lime flame produced at it touched his fingers.

Fladdermöss once more deviated her gaze towards Hannah and Amir - *"Off you go then, I shall see you at the gathering, just before the Tiger summons you. Chop-chop!"* - she said in a motherly tone, ushering the kids out of her chamber.

As Hannah and Amir walked past the gate's umbral, Hannah whispered to Amir - *"You have been unnaturally quiet."*

*"... Unnaturally quiet? Do you understand what just happened? Sam was dead, then he was fine asking for flan whilst pulling a green flame from his chest, then a random girl popped out of nowhere and the thing that is 'unnatural' is my silence?"* - he replied to Hannah as he continued to scratch his head - *"I am confused that's that I am!"*

Hannah smiled, reassured with the fact that the world could be confusing but Amir will be Amir. She followed him and his ramblings as they disappeared out of view.

Sam walked towards the gate, the congregation of spirits awaited him in the cavern but he stopped and turned to give one last look to Fladdermöss - *"Could I ask one last question?"*

The spirit gave an inquisitive look to Sam - *"What's weighing you down Sam?"*

*"Well... Mr Wolf said, you have long forgotten your names..."* - he said.

*"Ok, but that is not a question."* - she replied.

*"Uhms. You told me your friends call you Moss and your name is Fladdermöss."* - he continued elaborating the premise to his question.

*"Oh, I see."* - she replied as she understood the direction of Sam's question - *"Fladdermöss is not my real name but the name I remember having. It means winged mouse. It is a silly joke. Either way, go and join your friends. The next trial is about to start."*

Sam nodded and rushed towards the next unknown.

# Suspire

Sam felt gravity pulling his body gently against the sand below it.

His meandering brain reconnected with the nerves of his extremities, removing the foreign sensation from the present, then it brought the memories about the current situation, memories about this happening a few times already. His consciousness navigated from the deepest parts of the immaterial to the mundane physicality of the world.

A warm puff of air, barely perceptible, caressed the skin on his face. It communicated the urgency that Sam had to regain his senses, so he began to open his eyes, adapting to the soft light filling up the room.

His pupils captured a world out of focus. His brain ordered a sharper image of whatever it was in front of Sam, so the pupils worked swiftly to lock onto the oncoming figure a few inches of Sam's face. The image became clear, it was Amir's face closing in towards Sam, with his eyes tightly shut, and his lips pouting in preparation to make contact with his lips.

*"What the hell are you doing?"* - wondered Sam whilst pushing Amir's face as far as possible. Amir was incredibly strong and the floor fought against Sam.

Amir's expression changed quickly as he opened his eyes. It was pure relief - *"Sam! You are **alive**!"* - he said, half crushing, half hugging Sam. It was that type of hugs in which you could use the phrase *‘Love kills’* followed by the mumbled expression *‘its recipient’*.

*"I... can't.... breathe! My ribs... my... ribs."* - said Sam. Though, it was more an asphyxiated yelp for help than anything else.

Hannah rammed Amir's back to push him off Sam - *"Amir! Let him go! If he wasn't dead before, he might be wishing he was!"*

Hannah's action made Amir recall the last few events, he felt the need to explain himself - *"Erm... hums... About that kiss... it was her idea!"*

*"Nah-uh!"* - reacted Hannah immediately - *"All I said was that, if Sam were a sleepy girl he would be surrounded by a tall young man without the sense of personal space and at least seven very short ones called Floopy, Nasty, Lumpy, Yeasty, Funky, Cheesy and Ramon... or something along those lines."*

*"Why would I be surrounded? Why? What?"* - replied Sam. His brain struggled to understand the concept.

Hannah continued - *"Amir asked that too, I had to explain that just because a girl who slept too deep after she ate a fruit, doesn't give consent to a prick to lick her face!"*

Sam wondered if the story was going to make sense at some point.

Hannah gave a look to Sam, she was slightly blushed - *"I didn't tell him to kiss you."*

*"Yea-uh! You did!"* - added Amir - *"You told me if I knew ABC!"*

*"CPR!"* - she replied - *"I asked if you knew CPR!"*

*"Of course I know C, P and R!"* - continued Amir arguing - *"I know all of them. From the A to the Z!"*

*"Amir, we have gone through this! I have explained it!"* - she replied.

"Anyway Sam, she told me to do it!" - continued Amir - *"She said that one of us might need to help him breathe... like mouth to mouth thing, you know?"*

*"But I didn't mean you!"* - said Hannah.

*"Well... huh... I love my friend, but I was **NOT** going to let you kiss him!"* - argued Amir - *"What am I? Painted on the wall?"*

*"I am sure you had your motives, but could you... please, not yell"* - Sam felt his head pounded with so much shouting. The pain had a companion called almost-broken-ribs.

*"I did what I did to save him!"* - continued Amir in heated discussion with Hannah.

*"He is my friend too! I would have done it if you wouldn't have jumped on him!"* - Hannah continued the argument - *"Almost as if you wanted to take advantage of the situation!"*

*"I did not jump on him!"* - said Amir shocked at Hannah's implication.

*"Fladdermöss, could you take me with you?"* - said Sam, hoping the statue reanimated itself, extending her wings around Sam, driving him back into the land of the dreams.

Amir's argument got halted in mid air - *"Flan and mousse? What do you mean with Flan and Mousse? Are you hungry?"*

Sam smiled to himself - *"Fladdermöss, that's the name of this sprit"* - he added and remembered the location of the statue. The statue's menace had disappeared as Sam noticed, the fearfulness it projected was gone.

The sculpture fixated as decoration of the cavern had changed from Sam's initial impression. It was a slender young woman wearing an oversized cape with padded shoulders. The cape had the same leathery texture as before, but the proportions accommodated a figure a lot more human than before.

Sam observed the mask once again, it certainly had features difficult to love; however he smiled and extended his hand to touch it.

*"Sam? What are you doing?"* - said Hannah - *"I wouldn't do that, the last time when you got close to the statue you fainted."*

*"Did I?"* - said Sam half-mindedly. His memories were quite fresh. He could see in the darkest sections of his imagination the statue moving, jumping from one to the other, disappearing under the cape - *"I can't remember what happened when we came in."*

*"Are you serious? Can't you remember Hannah and I walking in, picking up the two candles and lighting it up?"* - said Amir - *"As soon as the statue was illuminated you walked straight to it and passed out."*

Sam remained quiet, he remembered the last conversation with Fladdermöss - *It was all a dream, even before I came in the room. There was no attack, she took me in as soon as I saw her.*

Sam remembered the warmth of his flame pulsing before drifting away. He brought his hands close to his chest and the warmth sensation poured from it, as if a cup of hot soup has been placed on his hands in a really cold day. A glimmer made him look down, just to find a lime coloured flame dancing between his fingers.

*"Woooah!"* - said Amir scratching his head - *"How? How did you do that?"*

*"She gave it to me"* - replied Sam looking at the statue - *"It is the light of the trial."*

*"Interesting"* - said Hannah as she connected the few clues Sam had given out - *"Does that mean the trial is done?"* - she asked impulsively as questions filled her mind with doubts - *"Wait... Why did she give you the light?"*

*"What do you mean why?"* - replied Sam - *"The important part is we have the light, no?"*

*"Huh? I thought we all had to do the trial?"* - followed up Hannah. Questions filled her head.

*"I see, you like to overthink as well, huh?"* - said a delicate voice behind the children.

Sam recognised the young female voice. The child form of Fladdermöss stood under her statue.

She casted soft light around her, her mask at the top of her head showing her face - *"You should probably head on to the next trial."*

Hannah watched her, her mind scrambled to reorganise her thoughts - *"is she The Bat?"*

*"Yeah, she is the spirit guarding this trial."* - briefly replied Sam.

*"But I thought, the spirits could only show themselves in their worlds or around the pillar outside?"* - queried Hannah.

*"Ha!"* - reacted Fladdermöss with the same tone someone would use to explain how wrong you are - *"Is there any written rule anywhere that we should follow? No little girl, we are free to roam everywhere and anywhere we want inside of the cave of prophecies."*

Hannah continued to examine the spirit in front of her - *"But the statue... you look very different!"*

Fladdermöss gave a cheeky look at Sam whilst inspecting Hannah - *"Should I examine her as well?"*

Sam shook his head side to side.

*"Very well then"* - She whispered to Sam - *"You have learnt your lesson."* - and winked at him. He didn't reply, he focused on the warmth the lime flame produced as it touched his fingers.

Fladdermöss once more deviated her gaze towards Hannah and Amir - *"Off you go then, I shall see you at the gathering, just before the Tiger summons you. Chop-chop!"* - she said in a motherly tone, ushering the kids out of her chamber.

As Hannah and Amir walked past the gate's umbral, Hannah whispered to Amir - *"You have been unnaturally quiet."*

*"... Unnaturally quiet? Do you understand what just happened? Sam was dead, then he was fine asking for flan whilst pulling a green flame from his chest, then a random girl popped out of nowhere and the thing that is 'unnatural' is my silence?"* - he replied to Hannah as he continued to scratch his head - *"I am confused that's what I am!"*

Hannah smiled, reassured with the fact that the world could be confusing but Amir will be Amir. She followed him and his ramblings as they disappeared out of view.

Sam walked towards the gate, the congregation of spirits awaited him in the cavern but he stopped and turned to give one last look to Fladdermöss - *"Could I ask one last question?"*

The spirit gave an inquisitive look to Sam - *"What's weighing you down Sam?"*

*"I remember Mr. Wolf mentioning you all lost your names..."* - he said.

*"Ok, but that is not a question."* - she replied.

*"I wondered if you will remember our names after we leave the cave."* - he crafted the phrase.

*"Are you scared of me forgetting your name?"* - she asked as she understood the direction of Sam's question - *"You have a piece of me. That piece of me will never forget you as long as you are alive... and even beyond."*

*"Fladdermöss?"* - he asked.

*"Yeah?"*

*"Why do you were these masks?"* - said Sam pointing to the Bat's mask.

*"First you forget names, then you forget faces."* - she added, smiling as she remembered how that phrase went - *"Either way, it is time for you to join your friends. The next trial is about to start."*

Sam nodded and rushed towards the next unknown.

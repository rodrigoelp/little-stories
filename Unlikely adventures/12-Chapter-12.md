# Conversations in the wind

*"... as if I would dare to, right?"* - said the black-winged girl as her dreadlocks swayed from shoulder to shoulder, her statement left incomplete to spectators tuning too late to the transmission.

*"Oh, come on Tere; the moment is ripe, you know?"* - expressively said the tall boy with grass-green wings. His big smile shone bright with the warm light surrounding them - *"The sun is sunny! You can lay low and rest, you know? it all flows, you know? We can feel the grass on our face and neck..."*

*"...‘You know?’, yes, I know."* - said Theresa sarcastically, interrupting the fascinating statements - *"Your lexicological abilities are getting better by the day, my gorgeous Paw-Paw."*

*"Wow! Really?"* - said Paul bobbing his head with a big smile on his face as the ironic compliment missed his perception - *"So cool, you know? I try to learn good big words."*

*"Yes dear, you are the smartest person in the room"* - continued Theresa walking away from a cavern to a side of the temple right next to them - *"depending on the room."*



*"How in this universe you two met and got together is something I can't wrap my head around"* - said the puzzled red-winged boy just exiting the cavern shaded entrance - *"I mean, I've heard opposites attract but you two are the statistical extremes of the proverb!"*

*"Yeah man, I know, you know?"* - said Paul still oblivious of the meaning of the conversation happening around him - *"We are so extreme!"*

Theresa stopped her march, turned around and took Paul's face between her hands as if she was holding a precious cargo - *"My beautiful Paw-Paw... is there any neuron floating in your cranial cavity capable of engaging a meaningful dialogue? Ah, but you are so pretty."*



She gave two gentle slaps on Paul's cheeks and turned to face Mathias - *"I do not appreciate, you calling my Paw-Paw a neurological wonder because he sub utilise every synapsis in his cerebrum."*

*"Uh? Wait, but, I didn't call him stupid! You did!"* - replied Mathias gesturing with his red wings as his arms remained crossed filled with indignation.

*"She never said I am stupid!"* - replied Paul getting an arm tangled with his own wing - *"She said I am something-something wonder. Right, Tere?"*

*"That's right my mentally lethargic eye candy"* - replied Theresa sweetly to Paul. She extended her wings covering both their faces, a \*Smooch\* was heard.



*"So Tere, wanna do it?"* - said Paul with playful cheekiness, still under her black wings - *"We just roll downhill, yeah? It'll be fun, you know?"* - continued Paul staring at the tilted terrain with his big smile - *"The sun is sunny and if we just lay low..."*

*"Paw-Paw, I told you already, I won't dare to do it. My wings will get dirty, I get displeased with the sensation of grass against my skin not to mention how dizzy I'll get. I will just sit on the steps around there and I'll watch you roll. I find that a lot more entertaining."* - said Theresa patiently. Her waving dreadlocks charmed Paul, who watched her with puppy eyes as she walked away with her hair flapping with the wind as much as dreadlocks would move with a gentle breeze, not very much.



Mathias watched with odd fascination the pair of lovers. It was like watching an eagle play affectionately with a bunny. He couldn't understand the probabilities in which these two would meet and experience affection to one another, instead of one chasing the other with a murderous intent.

Shook himself awake after he imagined a series of winged bunnies running on the grass - *"Uhm, wonder where Yule is?"*

*"Maybe she went... recruiting the... new moths we... saw the other... day... you know?"* - added Paul as he rolled down the hill.

*"Yule recruiting moths? I doubt it."* - said Mathias to no one in particular - *"I mean, there is a non-zero chance she would take anybody under her tutelage. But not after..."*

He was interrupted by a sweet voice questioning - *"After what?"* - said Yule with a steady tone, stepping off the cavern.



Theresa, in an atypical impulse, felt the urgent need to roll down the hill with Paul. She threw herself headfirst, collecting with her dreadlocks hay, flowers and grass as she gained speed rolling away from Yule and Mathias.



*"Oh? I would've thought you were going to stay longer with the Wolf spirit."* - said Mathias diverting the conversation as he  aware of the idea that in principle you should never kick a wasps' nest.



*"Wolf is busy."* - said Yule, her pink wings seemed to shine intensely under the golden light of the sun - *"The kids did it, they took the challenge head-on."*



*"Poor bastards!"* - stated Mathias, trying to control his mouth from moving too much asking if she had an interest in the children - *"They are so young, I've never seen kids so eager to take it since... you did."*



Yule remained silent, fixated on a stone illuminated by pulsating rays of light. The stone stood out from the rest as it laid on a field of white and yellow flowers, gentle rocking with the wind.



*"Yule? is everything all right?"* - asked Mathias following the direction of her gaze, staring at the empty space above the stone in the flowery field.

*"I think I'll go and sit for a while"* - said  Yule stepping towards the sunbathed stone, her mind absent, lost in thoughts - *"... by myself, Mat. If you don't mind?"* - she added, stopping Mathias unconscious steps that had begun following her.

*"Oh, right!"* - complemented Mathias awkwardly - *"yes... sure... I'll better join those two. They will appreciate the third wheel, I hope. I heard it is really fun too!"* - added leaving Yule by herself, opening his hot red wings, propelling himself up and forward in the air with a single flap.



Yule's hair flicked with the forceful gush of air. She waited for a moment and then continued her march towards the sun-lit rock.

The wind gently flowed against her - *this feels nice* - she thought making progress towards the spot until she finally reached her. Her gaze turned towards her friends debating the levels of itchiness of certain strains of grass against their skin. She sat on the flower-covered area next to the stone.



*"Aaaaahhhh, the breeze and the sweet smell in the air is fantastic"* - she said to the vastness of the area as the wind softly caressed her back; gently rocking the feathers and ribbons attached to her clothes.



She remained quiet for an instant, covering her body with her wings and a tender hug - *"At times, I feel I could stay here forever."* - she continued her commentary to intangible ears.



She looked up, clouds rolled over the land covering large hills at each side of a temple. The sunlight gave a warm hue to her face, her skin felt warm on the areas sun rays landed.

*"I wonder if those kids will be alright, Wolfie can be quite protective of who's worthy and he is rough around the edges; agh, just remembered, the last two trials are the worst."* - continued Yule in her apparent self absorbed discussion.



Patches of clouds detached from the rest of the formation rolling over the hills, casting fuzzy patterns moving on the ground, eventually blocking the sunshine warming up Yule.

She observed the shaded shape scurrying away from her as if the cloud was commanded to move - *"Thank you, old friend."*

*"Your welcome."* - replied Virgil with his insubstantial figure resting on the stone.

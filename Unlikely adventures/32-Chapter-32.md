# Radiant butterflies

Theresa sifted the sand with a handmade sieve collecting seashells, pebbles and bits of coral which remained on the mesh. She placed a few of the items to the side, so she could scoop up some more sand and resume the categorisation of goodies.

*"Tere!"* - said a distant voice from the above.

Theresa recognised the voice of her loving partner; it draw a loving smile on her face. She pushed one of her dreadlocks over her ear in an attempt to relax. She felt her heart pounding slightly faster as she stood up leaving her things on the ground.

Paul landed metres away from Theresa, probably to protect her as he carried enough momentum to skid across the shore to a few steps away from her, just stopping a few centimetres shy but close enough to be engulfed by Theresa's arms.

*"Hey silly boy"* - she said burying her face on Paul's chest. One deep breath told her the state of cleanliness her garments where. She had grown to love the smell of dirt and grass.

*"Whatcha doin?"* - said Paul casually.

*"Looking for colours!"* - she togged on his robes - *"I've found some very interesting. Look at these!"*

On top of a flat stone behind her there was a small pile of items: half a dozen violet Jacaranda flowers, grey feathers with bright orange tips, maroon maple leaves, one large white clamp shell which glimmered with satin finesse under the ever-going morning light and a lump of blue marbled sea shells.

*"I wonder if we will get some nice hues out of these"* - she added - *"Perhaps the little moths will like them."*

*"Sweet as!"* - replied Paul, grabbing a maple leaf and raising it above his head. The shine of the leaf attracted a growing butterfly. It flapped its wings gently before landing on the leaf. Through its legs and proboscis, the colour started to colour started to permeate into its pure white body, reaching its wings tinting it with maroon and a black pattern on its edge. The butterfly took off to the skies leaving a maroon trail behind it, sparkling away.

*"Looks neat!"* - said Paul still entranced with the butterfly - *"Anyways, let's go to the highlands."*

*"The Highlands? Are we going to the village of Prairie?"* - Theresa felt curious about the sudden instruction - *"Are we done here?"*

*"Yeah..."* - Paul checked his back, somewhat awkwardly before he completed the sentence in a lower voice - *"Matt rubbed Yule the wrong way and she told us to go there, you know?"*

*"Wait, Yule isn't coming?"* - she added more puzzled than before.

*"Yeah nah"* - replied Paul feeling the salty mist of the waves on his face - *"Toldya Matt pulled her chain, you know?"*

*"My beautiful Paul, I do not know, you've got to enunciate properly. Plus, you are not explaining yourself very well. What happened?"*

*"Righto!"* - replied Paul, paying close attention to the way his mouth moved - *"I got there and said blah-blah-blah to Yule when Matt arrived and asked bazillion question and she told us to go."*

*"The devil's in the detail."* - added Theresa.

*"Huh?"* - replied Paul unsure at her statement - *"Is Matt possessed with devil?"*

Theresa watched lovingly Paul and remembered love can give you patience if you take a deep breath and imagine yourself strangling your significant other - *"... What I mean is, I need to know the context of his questions, dear Paul."*

*"Ok... the gist is, he got tired of waiting to the little dudes and she doesn't want to move from the temple"* - explained Paul.

Theresa raised her hand to stop Paul's commentary, she didn't need further explanation; not that she was able to continue the conversation either way as she saw a red flapping dot moving across the clouds - *"Mathias is about to get here."*

Paul turned and watched the very exhausted red winged boy land on the soft grass, metres away from them - *"Mate, what took you so long?"*

Mathias felt anger raising from his stomach up to his throat - *"You mother f..."*

*"It is great to have you here, Mathias"* - interrupted Theresa before he completed the phrase - *"You are elder-sent. I've collected a few things and I would love your strong hands and magnificent pockets to carry everything to Prairie."*

*"Huh? But, wait!"* - he complained to Theresa's deaf ears. She had started stuffing seashells and leaves down his pockets - *"Why isn't Paul carrying these things?"*

*"My dude, I am already packing, you know?"* - replied Paul showing his bulged pockets - *"Don't worry Matt, the extra weight is awesome for training, you know? It takes a day or two to get to the Highlands."*

Mathias exhaustion made him jealous of the energetic Paul - *"It takes you a day to get there. It will take me much longer!"*

*"It takes three days to get to the Sanctuary Islands"* - added Theresa, dreaming about its clear waters to come.

*"What?"* - replied Mathias feeling confused - *"The Highlands aren't close to the Sanctuary Islands!"*

*"It is ok, we'll take a detour"* - answered Theresa.

*"But I don't want to go to Sanctuary."* - argued Mathias - *"Yule isn't going there either!"*

*"That's not a problem. She'll find us, in time"* - Theresa waved dismissively.

Mathias gestured whilst trying to find the appropriate words to say - "I... Uhms... I am not going there."*

Theresa gave a puzzled look at Mathias expression and determination. It was uncharacteristic of him to fight back - *"Why don't you want to go to Sanctuary?"*

*"He has some beef with his bro, you know?"* - explained Paul.

*"Thanks for the elaborated and eloquent description of the problem my gorgeous-yet-lexically-challenged sweet paw-paw."* - replied Theresa.

*"No probs"* - nodded Paul ignoring the second hand compliment.

Theresa sighed and returned to her conversation with Mathias - *"Either way, what's the problem with Izzy?"*

*"I... I don't want to discuss this"* - said Mathias in an attempt to dismiss the subject.

*"For sure, it is about his partner, you know?"* - pointed out Paul partially mind-absently watching the butterflies flapping around.

*"For flocks sake, Paul. You've gotta learn to hold your breath!"* - Mathias replied exasperated.

*"I know how. Why?"* - the message managed to evade successfully Paul's neurological pathways.

*"Then hold it right now"* - commanded Mathias.

Theresa was delighted with the development. She had rarely seen Mathias show this amount of emotion - *"Whilst he does that, what's your problem with your brother and his partner?"*

A caricaturist would have been able to draw Mathias as a locomotive fuming from the top of his head. He dedicated an intense gaze to Paul and added - *"I said, let's not talk about it."*

*"Fine!"* - said Theresa dismissing Mathias reluctance - *"You'll tell me when we arrive there."*

*"I am not going."* - stated Mathias  - *"I'll wait at our hut in the Hidden Forest."*

*"And how do you plan to get in? I locked the door, you know?"* - said Paul with a little of mocking tone.

*"What do you mean you locked the door? Why would you?"* - said Mathias slightly upset.

*"You know... Security."* - answered Paul naturally almost as if the answer was implicitly obvious.

*"Security of what? The hut is literally a tree trunk in the middle of the forest!"* - Mathias.

*"We have valuables, you know?"* - argued Paul in an attempt to make his case.

*"We have nothing of value!"* - Mathias fought back. 

*"Not true, my dude. We have ourselves and our memories, you know?"* - widely pointed Paul.

*"But... uh... but even in that case, those things are with us!"* - Mathias argued back.

*"... I see what you say, you know? Very deep! We carry everything with us, in spirit"* - Paul said mindfully.

*"My paw-paw, he implied there is nothing we care back at the hut"* - clarified Theresa, caressing Paul's hair.

*"We have a table and a set of chairs..."* - added Paul to his claims - *"Look dude, we are a gang, you know? Gangs don't split, otherwise we are not a gang, you see?"*

Paul's words bounced a few times inside Mathias. It annoyed him - *"But Yule's staying."*

*"Yeah, that's different, you know?"* - argued Paul.

*"How is that different? Yule decided she wants to stay here by herself and why can't I be by myself?"* - Mathias felt resentment and the rebellious impulse a teenager would experience fighting with their parents. Not that Mathias knew that from first hand experience given all children of light were born out of fragments of stars raining down on this world.

Theresa understood Mathias feelings but added - *"Matt, Yule is a complex character. Yule is Yule, but she is part of our gang."*

Mathias remained silent. His anger had mixed with other emotions making him struggle to voice anything else.

Paul threw his arm around Mathias shoulders - *"Manyways, fleeing home so you don't catch up with your bro is not cool, you know?"*

*"... I am not going"* - restated Mathias after a few minutes.

*"But dude, you know, if I had a kid bro like Izzy, I would be running like a headless chicken to visit, you know?"* - argued Paul.

*"Take him, he's all yours."* - Mathias added dismissively.

*"Is he?"* - smiled Paul feeling rejoiced about his new family group.

*"No Paw-paw. Tsk. Just go and pick up the rest of the things so we can leave now"* - said Theresa patting Paul on his back. Theresa felt it was better to warp things up, otherwise these two would continue with futile conversations. Theresa felt,  'it is one of those times you need to apply your motherly instincts because kids are hopeless.'

*"Yeah, Ok"* - said Paul turning his back to Theresa and Mathias. He picked up a few things from a colourful pile and chucked it in his pockets.

*"Mattie. I will say this as sweetly as possible. You are coming and that's the end of it"* - said Theresa in a commanding voice. As things go, Theresa felt a good command needs to be followed by one of those 'or else' sort of phrases - *"Don't make me drag you there by your ears. My grip is pretty good and your ears look awfully sensitive. Plus, think about this as training with Paul."*

Mathias unconsciously covered his ears. Theresa had this quality that makes you think ‘That wasn't just a threat’ 

*"I don't need that much training to do... I am not **that** out of shape"* - complained Mathias to Yule's, Paul's and Theresa's implied suggestions of training.

Theresa refuted - *"You lost your wind coming to Dawn."*

*"It was bloody far!"*

Paul felt excited imagining the types of training he could do with Mathias - *"My dude, I'll work you to the bone"*

*"Oh! Lucky me!"* - replied Mathias with disdain.

*"Sweet as!"* - replied Paul not following the sarcasm - *"Tere, I'm all done. Let's take off."*

Theresa gave one final look to Mathias expression filled with resignation - *"I can't wait for the warm and gentle breeze. Beautiful islands, here we come!"*

The memories of his brother filled Mathias' mind - *It has been a while since we last saw each other* - It felt somewhat bittersweet. He was anxious.

(FLUWHOSSH!)

Mathias watched up and saw Paul holding Theresa's hand as they flew away - *Here we go again...* - and he took off, chasing the pair, leaving behind butterflies glowing in the air as they flew past.

# Radiant butterflies

Theresa sifted the sand with a handmade sieve collecting seashells, pebbles and bits of coral which remained on the mesh. She placed a few of the items to the side, so she could scoop up some more sand and resume the categorisation of goodies.

*"Tere!"* - said a distant voice from the above.

Theresa recognised the voice of her loving partner; it always drew a loving smile on her face. She pushed one of her dreadlocks over her ear in an attempt to relax from the sweet anxiety you feel when you reunite with someone you missed dearly. She felt her heart pounding slightly faster as she stood up leaving her things on the ground.

Paul landed several metres away from Theresa, probably to protect her as he carried enough momentum to skid across the shore to a few steps away from her, just stopping a few centimetres shy but close enough to be engulfed by Theresa's arms.

*"Hey silly boy"* - she said burying her face on Paul's chest. One deep breath told her the state of cleanliness of his garments. She had grown to love the smell of grass, flowers and dirt.

*"Whatcha doin?"* - said Paul casually barely feeling Theresa's tight grip.

*"Looking for new colours!"* - she togged on his robes - *"I've found some very interesting here and there. Take a look!"*

On top of a flat stone behind her, a make belief table of sorts, there was a small pile of items: half a dozen violet Jacaranda flowers, grey feathers with bright orange tips, maroon maple leaves, one large white clamp shell which glimmered with satin finesse under the ever-going morning light and a lump of blue marbled sea shells.

*"I wonder if we will get some nice hues out of these"* - she added - *"Perhaps the little moths will like them."*

*"Sweet as!"* - replied Paul, grabbing a maple leaf and raising it above his head. The light shone through the of the leaf attracting a glowing butterfly. It flapped its wings gently before landing on the leaf. Through its legs and proboscis, the colour permeated into its pure white body, reaching its wings; tinting it with shades of maroon and a black pattern on its edge. The butterfly took off to the skies leaving a maroon trail behind it, sparkling away.

*"Looks neat!"* - said Paul still entranced with the butterfly - *"Anyways, let's go to the highlands."*

*"The Highlands? Are we going to the village of Prairie?"* - Theresa felt curious about the sudden instruction - *"Are we done here?"*

*"Yeah..."* - Paul checked his back, somewhat awkwardly before he completed the sentence in a lower voice - *"Matt rubbed Yule the wrong way and she told us to go there, you know?"*

*"Wait, Yule isn't coming?"* - she added more puzzled than before.

*"Yeah nah"* - replied Paul feeling the salty mist of the waves on his face - *"Toldya Matt pulled her chain, you know?"*

*"My beautiful Paul, I do not know, you've got to enunciate properly. Plus, you are not explaining yourself very well."* - there were a few things in life Theresa would love to change, one of them is the way Paul uses his words -  *"Tell me what happened?"*

*"Righto!"* - replied Paul, paying close attention to the way his mouth moved - *"I got there and said blah-blah-blah to Yule when Matt arrived and asked a bazillion questions to her before she told us to go away."*

*"The devil's in the details."* - added Theresa.

*"Huh?"* - replied Paul unsure at her statement - *"Is Matt possessed by a devil or something?"*

Theresa watched lovingly Paul and remembered love can give you patience if you take a deep breath and imagine yourself strangling your significant other - *"... What I mean is, I need to know the context of his questions, my dear Paul."*

*"Ok... the gist of it is, he got tired of waiting to the little dudes and she doesn't want to move from the temple"* - explained Paul.

Theresa raised her hand to stop Paul's commentary, she didn't need further explanation; not that she was able to continue the conversation either way as she saw a red flapping dot moving across the clouds - *"Mathias is about to get here."*

Paul turned and watched the very exhausted red winged boy land on the soft grass, metres away from them - *"Mate, what took you so long?"*

Mathias felt anger raising from his stomach up to his throat - *"You mother flo.."*

*"It is great to have you here, Mathias"* - interrupted Theresa before he completed the phrase - *"You are elder-sent. I've collected a few things and I would love your strong hands and magnificent pockets to carry everything to Prairie."*

*"Huh? But, wait!"* - he complained to Theresa's deaf ears. She had started stuffing seashells and leaves down his pockets - *"Why isn't Paul carrying these things?"*

*"My dude, I am already packing, you know?"* - replied Paul showing his bulged pockets - *"Don't worry Matt, the extra weight is awesome for training, you know? It takes a day or two to get to the Highlands."*

Mathias' exhaustion made him jealous of Paul's energy levels - *"It takes you a day to get there. It will take me much longer!"*

*"It takes three days to get to the Sanctuary Islands"* - added Theresa, dreaming about its clear waters to come.

*"What?"* - replied Mathias feeling confused - *"The Highlands aren't anywhere near to the Sanctuary Islands!"*

*"It is ok, we'll take a detour"* - answered Theresa.

*"But I don't want to go to Sanctuary."* - argued Mathias - *"Yule isn't going there either!"*

*"That's not a problem. She'll find us, in time"* - Theresa waved dismissively.

Mathias gestured whilst trying to find the appropriate words to express his frustration - "I... Uhms... I am not going there."*

Theresa gave a puzzled look at Mathias expression and determination. It was uncharacteristic of him to fight back - *"Why don't you want to go to Sanctuary?"*

*"He has some beef with his bro, you know?"* - explained Paul whilst chasing a crab narrowing escaping his grip.

*"Thanks for the elaborated and eloquent description of the problem my gorgeous-yet-lexically-challenged sweet paw-paw."* - replied Theresa.

*"No probs"* - nodded Paul ignoring the second hand compliment.

Theresa sighed and returned to her conversation with Mathias - *"Either way, what's the problem with Izzy?"*

*"I... I don't want to discuss this"* - said Mathias in an attempt to dismiss the subject.

*"It might be about his partner, you know?"* - pointed out Paul partially mind-absently watching the butterflies flapping around.

*"For flocks sake, Paul"* - Mathias replied exasperated - *"You've gotta learn to hold your breath!"*

*"I know how. Why?"* - the message managed to evade successfully Paul's neurological pathways.

*"Then hold it right now"* - commanded Mathias.

Theresa was delighted with the development. She had rarely seen Mathias this worked up - *"Whilst he does that, what's your problem with your brother and his partner?"*

A caricaturist would have been able to draw Mathias as a locomotive fuming from the top of his head. He dedicated an intense gaze to Paul and added - *"I said, let's not talk about it!"*

*"Fine!"* - said Theresa dismissing Mathias reluctance - *"I'll find out once I get there."*

*"I am not going."* - firmly stated Mathias  - *"I'll wait at our hut in the Hidden Forest."*

*"And how do you plan to get in? I locked the door, you know?"* - said Paul with a little of mocking tone.

*"What do you mean you locked the door? Why would you?"* - said Mathias more than a little upset.

*"You know... Security and stuff."* - answered Paul naturally almost as if the answer was implicitly obvious.

*"Security of what?"* - replied Mathias completely and utterly appalled - *"The hut is literally a tree trunk in the middle of the forest! It has beds and a table, nothing else."*

*"We have valuables, you know?"* - argued Paul in an attempt to make his case.

*"We have nothing of value!"* - Mathias fought back.

*"Not true, my dude. We have ourselves and our memories, you know?"* - broadly pointed out Paul.

*"But... uh... but, we have those things are with us!"* - Mathias had begun to lose the interest in the fight. It is increasingly difficult to argue against Paul logic, that is the absolute lack of it.

*"... I see what you say, you know? Very deep! We carry everything with us, in spirit"* - Paul said mindfully.

*"My paw-paw, he implied there is nothing we care back at the hut"* - clarified Theresa, caressing Paul's hair.

*"He just said we our table and a set of chairs..."* - added Paul to his claims - *"Look dude, we are a gang, you know? Gangs don't split, otherwise we are not a gang, you see?"*

Paul's words bounced a few times inside Mathias mind like a bullet would ricochet inside of a thing from which bullets ricochet. The phrase ‘we are a gang’ annoyed him - *"That's not true. Yule's staying!"*

*"Yeah, that's different, you know?"* - Paul dismissed his argument.

*"How is that different? Yule decided she wants to stay here by herself and why can't I be by myself?"* - Mathias felt resentment and the rebellious impulse a teenager would experience when their parents told them that they are not allowed to attend that very important concert everybody in their school are going to. Not that Mathias knew that from first hand experience given all children of light were born out of fragments of stars raining down on this world. They didn't have schools either.

Theresa understood Mathias feelings but added - *"Matt, She is a complex character. Yule is Yule, but she is part of our gang."*

Mathias remained silent. His anger had mixed with other emotions making him struggle to voice anything else. He had reached the stage at which people limit themselves to grunt a little.

Paul threw his arm around Mathias shoulders - *"Anyways, fleeing to home so you don't catch up with your bro is not cool, you know?"*

*"... I am not going"* - restated Mathias after a few minutes.

*"But dude, you know, if I had a kid bro like Izzy, I would be running like a headless chicken to visit, you know?"* - argued Paul.

Mathias felt, it didn't matter how much he expressed his discontent, he would be forced to go and face his family. He hated it. He tried to compose a mature sentence, instead what it came was resembled a child about to throw a tantrum after their grandpa ate one grape out of his plate - *"Take him, he is all yours!"*

*"Is he?"* - smiled Paul feeling rejoiced about his new found family group.

*"No Paw-paw. Tsk. Just go and pick up the rest of the things so we can leave now"* - said Theresa patting Paul on his back. Theresa felt it was better to warp things up, otherwise these two would continue with futile conversations. Theresa felt the 'it is one of those times you need to apply your motherly instincts because kids are hopeless.'

*"Yeah, Ok"* - said Paul turning his back to Theresa and Mathias. He picked up a few things from a colourful pile and chucked it in his pockets.

*"Mattie. I will say this as sweetly as possible. You are coming and that's the end of it"* - said Theresa in a commanding voice. As things go, Theresa felt a good command doesn't need to followed by one of those 'or else' sort of phrases, but better be threatening than sorry - *"Don't make me drag you there by your ears. My grip is pretty good and your ears look soft and squishy, not to mention awfully sensitive."*

Theresa had this quality that made you think ‘That wasn't just a threat, was it?’. Mathias almost immediately covered his ears.

Theresa smiled at his reaction - *"Plus, think about all the training you can do with Paw paw!"*

*"I don't need that much training to do... I am not **that** out of shape"* - complained Mathias to Yule's, Paul's and Theresa's implied suggestions of training over the past few days.

*"You lost your wind coming to Dawn."* - yelled Paul from the distance.

*"It was bloody far!"* - excused Mathias.

Paul felt excited imagining the types of training he could do with Mathias - *"My dude, I'll work you to the bone!"*

*"Oh! Lucky me!"* - replied Mathias with disdain.

*"Sweet as!"* - replied Paul not following the sarcasm - *"Tere, I'm all done. Let's take off."*

Theresa gave one final look to Mathias expression filled with resignation - *"I can't wait for the warm and gentle breeze. Beautiful islands, here we come!"*

Mathias couldn't help but remember his brother - *It has been a while since we last saw each other* - It felt somewhat bittersweet. He was anxious.

A loud *FLUWHOSSH* rushed a strong wind, making Mathias wings flap uncontrollably, as he watched up and saw Paul holding Theresa's hand, flying away.

 *Here we go again...* - thought Mathias as he took off, chasing the pair, leaving behind sparkling butterflies, rolling around in the turbulent flow of air as they flew past.

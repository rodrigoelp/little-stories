# Isle of Dawn

Aeons ago, the shores of an unnamed coast witnessed a marvellous event. The heavens opened up to the stars; a cosmic rain brought down little sparks, glistening on the sand before flaring up into the first guests of these shores.

Once their flames had settled into a shape, their mood focused on the here and now. They looked around in perplexed admiration, wondering about the sand below their feet and the sky above their heads.

Exploring their newfound bodies, they discovered the ability to summon the elements and build a home, right there, in the darkness of the night.

Out of the first ones to descend, the youngest one, sat down to appreciate the stars they came from. He could feel his flame beating in sync as stars pulsated high above the sky.

He knew something special was about to happen and, almost on cue, the sun rose for the first time. They bathe on the light of their new star and appreciated their new home.

Throughout the rest of the day, more stardust rained on the shores, new children rose from the sands to join the spirit of exploration and curiosity.

The first ones to arrived became guides to the newly born. Took them to trials and challenges to grow their skills and expand their new realm. It was a cycle, the cosmic rain continued to pour down and loving figures came to their guidance, showing them around.

The once small population steadily grew, they roughly built a temple in admiration to the mountain in front of them. A new night brought more newcomers turning the once comfortable caves into cramped spaces.

The ancient elders sat around the fire to discuss their actions. The youngest one of the elders proposed to set sail away from their makeshift temple and build a proper one on the mountain. It would help them see far beyond the confinements of the shores and expand their minds. They all agreed and so, they built the first temple of the Star Children.

The temple was a nice improvement over their previous arrangements; they had enough space to accommodate many and space to roam. The temple attracted little creatures of light. They saw, filled with wonder a mountain far beyond a sea of clouds and valleys, a mountain so tall it could reach the sky. They called it Eden.

The youngest elder descended from the temple every night, waiting for the new wave of kids to arrive at the shores and wait until dawn, so the sunlight recharged their soul before flying up to the temple. He did it gladly, he considered every single kid precious and gave them the love they deserved. Then he would shepherd them up to the temple. Many saw him, and his paternal instincts as a warm welcome to the world, so they called him Father.

Time flew by, their settlement grew crowded and tightly packed. Most of the elders voted to move to new lands and explore. Father, rose his hand and decided to stay behind, he wanted to welcome the cosmic rain into this world for the rest of his days.

And so, the Star Children built boats and set to find new realms. Father descended every night and came back to the temple with new children every day (just after dawn). It was a placid routine.

Aeons went past.

Seasons changed.

Every new day made a dent on the young Elder. His beard grew longer, his bones ached. He grew old but happy.

He had endured for so long, the first elders had come to past but, he remained at his post, greeting the sunlight with a new cohort of children.

Eventually, he stopped descending from the temple. His flame required more care than the good old days, he was not fit enough to watch the dawn of a new day but he was always happy to see new light seekers. He rang the bells of his temple to summon and guide (at a distance) the new arrivals.

His realm was empty, many were just travellers seeking other realms. The caves in which the first children had lived in, in which they grew were not suitable for a prolonged stay and the temple lacked candour in comparison to other realms. However, his existence wasn't a lonely one. Every now and then, elders from other realms would invite him over, he would visit gladly, for a short period, before returning to his duties.

Deep down, he was happy the Star Children had found more nourishing environments, he just had a hint of melancholy about the old days, in which Dawn was filled with people going about.

Those days will never return - he thought. Destiny had a different plan on its way.

Realms shook, winds changed and darkness flowed from Eden on the realms. Father gathered every little pure soul and brought them to the shores of Dawn.

They arrived late at night, most of them were asleep and exhausted due to the long journey. He was badly injured.

*"Come on old flame"* - said tapping on his chest - *"don't give up on me now, we got to save the little ones before the sun sets tomorrow."* the flickering flame gently leaking of a crack on his chest. His mask was falling apart, his ropes losing its glow, his fingers shaking as he grabbed the staff and cast one last spell.

Every little kid floated in the air, surrounded by light. The little cocoons took them away from the shores deep into the sea, to an island in between the realms and the sky.

Kneeling on the sand with his mask falling and turning into dust, he focused his last energy on the spell, pushing the kids further away. The sun rose one last time, the light of dawn covered every aspect of the isle in an attempt to heal him. Father was pleased with his old friend giving him strength.

As the day faded and the sky changed its colours, he looked up at the night sky: *"You are safe now my dear children. Even though the stars die, their light stretches deep into the void. Press on my little ones for you are children of light now. Return to clean these lands from the darkness when the time is right..."*

The sound went silent.

The sky that night was pristine and clean, void of shooting stars or clouds.

The wind had stopped blowing.

The waves had stopped moving.

The night made a pact with the world to pay respect to such a noble soul.

When the sun rose from the sea was not greeted as usual by the smiling old man. His staff was the only reminder that once there was a ruler of the Isle of Dawn.

# Vault of Knowledge

To tell the story behind the Vault of Knowledge is to talk about the Golden City as well. The Vault of Knowledge, also known as the Golden City Vault, was a temple dedicated to magic research, learn the subtleties of the flow of time and to save to posterity the knowledge of the Star Children.



Once the scholars began collecting as m

any books as possible and research magic within its walls, they noticed how the knowledge became power which could distort space-time itself. Even though the Vault was a temple in the city, it became its own realm.

As the Vault was excavated deep in Mount Eden and guarded by the army of the Golden City, many thought its contents were so precious and inaccessible that it needed such extreme measures to protect its contents but, the truth is: the Vault was carefully built protect the outside world from unintended experiment failures when scholars (attempting to create a fizzy drink) ended up blowing up sections of the library and setting on fire the new extensions of the Vault.

Initially, the scholars and sages built the first few chambers but, as lazy as they were, started to research different mechanisms to elevate themselves without too much effort. Created elevators and floating islands, recreated the stars and constellations they could no longer see as well as the realms many have left behind to join the Vault. Many visitors felt confused at first, they could not understand how the Vault was bigger on the inside than the Mount itself. Or how you could roam from one room to another and noticed you it is lunchtime when you just had dinner.



Intentionally... or unintentionally, the Vault was a tower dug out of the rock, magically extended in space-time to house almost infinite galleries. The Vault was surrounded with mysticism as very few knew all of its contents.



The Vault was a gateway, a path to enlightenment, personal development and nourishment.



Said mental nourishment was required as it was not an accident the Vault's location. Many of its scholars hypothesised Eden could allow the Star Children to reach the stars from which they descended aeons ago. The hypothesis became theory and not long after, it became a practical experiment once the citadel of Eden was built.



As the citadel was a harsh environment capable of extinguishing your spirit in an instant, anyone seeking to inhabit it had to spend a lifetime preparing in the Vault.



The Wise Elder was a permanent inhabitant of the top levels of the Vault, always closely guarded by the Warrior. She was not your regular above-smart-scholar, she created seven crystals to connect the realms and its Elders, by which they could exchange thoughts, feelings and magic. She gave one crystal to every realm: Dawn, Prairie, Hidden Forest, Valley, the Golden City and Eden, keeping one for herself.

From here, she could evaluate and judge each Star Children wanting to reach Eden. However, not many scholars were approved by the Wise Elder as she had noticed the most important piece of knowledge required to access Eden was not in your head, but in your heart.

If you were to describe the flow of time in the Vault. Some times it was slow; some other times it moved in zigzag. You could see a butterfly hatch from its cocoon twice a day, some times even more. It truly was wonderful and beautiful inside.



Eventually, a scholar experimenting with a new piece of magic found a passage to a new realm. It was different in every aspect to theirs, had strange boxes with moving images inside, a sort of boat on wheels and it had people who did not have flames on their hearts, though the scholars argued for a few days their flames might have trouble lighting up as they consumed a strange triangled flat food they called "pizza".

The Wise Elder set this new realm behind a magic wall to prevent many to reach it and she deemed it "dangerous territory".

The scholar, in an attempt to gain the trust of the Wise Elder, requested to recreate the experiment in a safer environment. The citadel of Eden was perfect for this occasion: it contained the smartest scholars and not many lived in it.

The Wise Elder conceded and summoned the elders to gather at the gates of Eden. The magic of the elders could cast a shield around the citadel as the experiment was conducted.

They all marched up to the citadel to investigate this new realm but, whatever it was, the experiment did not open a portal to the previous realm.

No-one other than the scholar knew what just happened, and she knew briefly before the darkness swallowed her whole. The Wise Elder casted her strong magic to contain whatever it was coming from the portal but it was not enough, she could feel each barrier giving out and commanded every elder to run away from Eden.

The Warrior looked at her with sentiment and waving goodbye rushed to the Golden City to assemble his army to fend off the horde spewing from Eden.

The Twins used their speed and stamina to run ahead and warn every soul about the oncoming disaster.

The Smith went to prepare the forest to house those displaced.

The Collector summoned the creatures of light. Set his way to save as many as possible.

And Father Elder called every child to Dawn, as far away as possible from the horrors attempting to leave Eden.



As to the Wise Elder, she bid farewell to all and returned to the top level of the Vault in an attempt to seal the gates to Eden. The scholars had lived for so long, they were ready to leave their flames to protect the Wise Elder reach the gate.

They all fought bravely, leaving their flames to extinguish as they progressed through the chambers of the Vault. But scholars, as prepared as they were for the facts of life, were not expecting to fight darkness which consumed their flames and magic. As they reached the top of the Vault an earthquake shook them to the core, the floating islands clashed down, chambers and its arches collapsed and the magic faded, leaving an empty husk of what the Vault used to be. Its magical constellations had disappeared, its mysterious glow reduced to nothing.

Disheartened due to the loss of light, the collapse of magic and the terrors descending towards the realms, the Wise Elder reached the gates of Eden and sealed it requiring the light of brave of warriors to reopen it. She returned to her throne to consult with her crystal but a sharp pain stroke her down, her love had fallen: the Warrior was no more.

With her flame on one hand and the crystal on the other, she cast one last spell to project an illusion, a mirage of what the Vault once was and froze the time within its walls, hoping that one day, the descendants of the light could look into the Vault and understand their destiny.



`Hear me out, child of light, we were proud and reached beyond the sky, so high that we have returned to the stars.` - these were the words engraved on the throne of the Wise Elder of the Vault of Knowledge.

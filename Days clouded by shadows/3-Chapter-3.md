# Valley of Triumph

Each realm has a bit of history before its Elders came around; how the land motivated them to explore or how the shores, mist or clouds called them. Every realm had life on its own before anybody wondered in.

Valley was different from the other realms. It was too cold, too high, too isolated for anyone to reach its gorgeous sunsets. So, in a way, you could say Valley was born the day the Twins were born.

Before a Star Child is born, a spark descends from the sky landing on Dawn. It would jiggle for a moment on the sand before turning into a flame that shapes the air and elements around it until it has a body and a soul.

The Twins deviated from that path just a bit...

Father Elder was an avid observed of the sky. He claims he saw a single lightning bolt cross the sky; it stroke down a snowy mountain, splitting it in two leaving a raging spark behind.

He promptly took off in search for the misplaced spark. By the time he got to the mountain, the spark was jumping from rock to rock melting the snow around it, trying to grow as quickly as it could consume anything around it in these frigid arid lands.

He tried to hold it with his staff but the spark split in two instead of flaring up, he sat down, mesmerised by the energy on its movements. He has seen most of the Star Children been born, but this was the first time he saw sparks actively trying to eat its way into existence. The two sparks grew into flames and quickly into souls and then into two children.

Father embraced both children...

Well, he wanted to embrace them but, he was too old and these children were too active to stay put. He could not have them both on his arms; they were competing with each other who could get away the fastest from the paternal grip. His ribs complained. A kick had landed on his side whilst a little hand was trying to rip off his mask and his staff hit the back his head followed by the laughter of the children.

*"How is this possible?"* - thought Father as one of the baby Twins started to run on the snow. The other one followed skating. One stumbled with a clump of snow sending him flying, the other one spread her arms and started flying.

The two were a force hard to control and contain.

Father smiled and spread his arms, he knew someone else was more capable to deal with the impetus of these two. The Smith was a perfect fit to raise and guide the Twins; she lacked motherly attributes, was strong-headed and short-tempered but, she could give shape to anything she lied her hands on. So, the Twins found a new home.

Time went on, the twins became teenagers and then, adults, but they never let go of their rivalry, despite the Smith lengthy conversations with them and reprimands to keep them under control.

Eventually, they left the safety of the temples hidden among the trees to seek a new environment, a new realm they could call their own. But before they embarked on their journey, they found and decorated two empty manta eggs, leaving it just outside of her temple. Far enough most Star Children would struggle to take them down but visible enough that she had a reminder: ***`"the Twins were here"`***.

Her eyebrow would twitch looking down into the forest; she never knew if they intended it as a compliment or a challenge.

For the Twins it was destiny, the very same mountain claimed to have been split by their birth was the place they were going to settle the snowy citadel of Triumph.

They and their followers set in every corner they could build, every snowy field was turned into slides, ramps and areas to demonstrate who was the best. It is obvious that the competition was inexistent if you compared anyone against the twins who excelled in every athletic area.

The Twins ruled the citadel and its inhabitants. It was a peaceful realm, filled with laughter, races and above all: bruises.

A common phrase in other realms was: *"If you were born in the Citadel of Triumph you must have a bruise, broken bone or you have a loose screw"*.

The battle arena and the frozen lake always offered good fun. The Twins were always the main attraction. But, eventually, the Twins grew tired of the same events, they longed for the excitement of a new challenge and they had conquered every sport they thought of.

This might explain in part, why they got too excited when the Elders were summoned to Eden. The Star Children bid farewell to their top athletes and saw then fly off towards the Golden City, which the citadel had amazing views of.

Life continued just as expected, some Star Children sliding down the ramps, the area filled with spectators and cheers. They all missed their idols and were looking forward to their return.

The cheering would go quiet when a tremor shook the citadel.

Curiosity filled their souls and wondered, what was that?

Their curiosity turned into dread when their heroes arrived exhausted, beat up and wounded.

The Twins revealed what just happened, a darkness flowing from Eden, swallowing whole the Golden City and Vault.

The Twins looked at the twin peaks and with great sorrow, asked every single Star Children to help the incoming refugees. The Golden City was vast and the gates of Triumph always welcomed every single guest.

One flash of light rose from the Golden City, striking through the sky ending in a big crackling and bolts of lightning.

Most looked up with awe.

The Twins felt it, the Warrior had fallen, the Golden City was a memory now and Vault was going to be next.

A second streak of pain went through their hearts as both turned to look towards the Vault, they knew the mountains they hold dear were no longer safe for their loved ones. They commanded every single living soul to seek refuge within the temples of Prairie and the Hidden Forest; the militaristic upbringing Smith infused on the Twins was showing.

As the Star Children left the citadel, the Twins stayed behind.

The mountains protected the citadel from whatever ravaged the Golden City and Vault, but they could feel there was a venom flowing through their flames. They continued organising the massive operation, guiding every Star Children away from the walls of the citadel into the safely of their ancestral realms.

The day came to past, the long walk to the forest came to an end. Star Children started to ask, what happened to the Twins after that fateful day.

They vanished among the confusion of the day.

There was no trace of them, just an empty citadel, the snow-covered twin peaks and the Valley of Triumph.

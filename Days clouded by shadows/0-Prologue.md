# Prologue

Understanding the concept of the Big Bang lead many to study cosmological oddities in an attempt to find deeper meaning in our existence. That process of evaluating our knowledge drove us to wonder complex questions such as *"if a painter slipped off their ladder whilst the ladder is floating in space, would the ground move towards them, or would they move towards the ground?"*

Said question changed our understanding of the universe in subtle ways. It provided the opportunity to rephrase our problems in a relative experimental frame, even though the end result would be a loud '*splat!'*

These thoughts drove our most brilliant minds to deeper, more meaningful questions like:

Would we know the state of survival of a cat placed in a sealed box with radioactive-poisonous elements in it?If the galaxy is called the milk way, is there a galactic cow roaming around?Is the universe by itself in the cosmos, or is it just bad body odour and nothing else wants to be close to it?If the big bang happened and no one is around to hear it, can we still call it the big bang?

Eventually, scientists theorised about what is beyond our universe: a multiverse of infinite possibilities.

Whilst our pocket of the multiverse contains four fundamental forces of nature governing every aspect of our existence, in the past, two additional forces ruled over the primordial cosmos. One of them was magic.

In some pockets of the multiverse, conditions failed to hold onto their magic. Gravity shaped the stars and planets, whilst the other forces allowed the matter to interact with itself, creating structures leading to cells, multi cells, animals and people.

In other pockets of the multiverse, conditions were just right to hold onto the elusive force magic is.

In one of them, the magical force shaped planetary formation around the back of four colossal elephants standing on the back of a cosmic turtle.

In another one, it shaped society to separate magical people from non-magical individuals. They would chase flying golden balls whilst flying on broomsticks, tattoo lightning bolts on their foreheads, and constantly scream at each other "Expelli-leviosa"... or something like that.

But this story, in particular, happened in a tiny-wee-small sleeve of the multiverse, an intersection between pockets if you will. A space so odd and quirky that magic influenced the formation of life itself, manifesting itself as the plasma irradiated by nearby stars, floating through space until it found a watery planet where to rain down on the land.

It is understandable if you doubt the processes required for plasma, little balls of fire, to become alive. Well, plasma just found the pulsing rhythm required to have a... Well... Pulse to gain recognition as a breathing, living and moving entity. Its principles are simple if you include enough magic, a pinch of chance, and we all ignore other processes leading to failure.

In any case, these lifeforms danced with the intensity of sparks and moved with the promptness of rocket fuel igniting on takeoff. They raged for a while and slowly calmed down, mixed with the elements on the ground, emerging in winged-humanoid forms. Or we should say they were born as flying people; so we can stay away from any theological arguments.

Their numbers grew with every passing day. They rained like an ocean over a desert... thought that mental image could be horrific and catastrophic.

They rained like pissing cows... no wait, this would be disgusting.  
They rained like cats and dogs... Ah, this is too cruel.  
They rained like... like... like shooting stars if shooting stars rained like heavy rain.  
The children grew to become men and women.  
The little settlements became towns and villages.

They became a single nation.

They sought the leadership of those more experienced and wise. Six individuals with the strongest affinity to magic they could find, and when they did, they called them primordials.

One of them pulsed with the music of the water.  
One of them danced to the rhythm of the air.  
One of them learnt the harmonics of the earth.  
One of them felt the melodic tune of the fire.  
One of them imbued life.  
One of them became the soul of death.

All together reigned over their bountiful little nation, though they did not like the word 'reign', as they didn't consider themselves kings or queens, they worked hard to protect their people and provide order to their nation.

*"What are we called?"* - asked a curious child to the primordial of life.

***Do we require a name?*** - He asked.

*"It wouldn't harm if it is all the same. If I want to tell a story to my friends about the birds I saw over my head, the mantas drifting to the distance, or whales singing from afar... I know how to refer to them, but what are we?"* - the child's face resonated with an unusual glow.

The primordial of life looked up to the sky, the place countless children rain over their realm. He smiled - ***We are children of the stars. Star Children.***

The name spread around their towns like a rumour about a coworker with an awkward member, very fast. People accepted their cosmic nature without any doubt, and why would they?

Their lives were unusually long, lasting eons.

They had seen many others descend from the cosmos above them and shape themselves as they secure their grip on life.

For all intent and purpose, they were nothing less than the earthly manifestation of the star shining through the day.

And they lived in harmony for many eons.

The primordials raised countless children, guided their people through the path of magical science, and taught them the ways of life. And most were happy... most, but not all.

Each new day made the primordial of death resent his area of expertise. The other primordials gave to the nation whilst his function was to take from it.

The resentment slowly changed into frustration, eventually leading to disagreement with the rest. He ignored any reason given about the importance of his role, but it did not tame his wish to nourish the people he loved as opposed to hurting them.

The constant argument marked the beginning of the end. The age of the primordials would soon come to an end.

The primordial of death left his friends behind to reinvent himself, to find a different purpose.

The star children picked on the absent primordial and watched with concern their loved guides argue with each other. Their stress reached the primordial of earth - *Perhaps, it is time for us to allow others to lead. Perhaps we have grown old and stubborn.*

The primordials of fire, water and air agreed.

The primordial of life remained quiet. He felt a responsibility to his people, but he couldn't do it alone.

*"It is Ok. Let's find a resting place fitting for us, when the little ones desire guidance, they will find us in there."* - said the primordial of air.

And so, they retired to a cave on the outskirts of their town. A cave well known to show its inhabitants fragments of the future.

The cave gain a higher status among the star children, from mystic to a holy place, a location where their most respected individuals retreated to enjoy their final eons.

The star children feared their path ahead without their loved guides, but year after year, they proved capable of living a fruitful and fulfilling life without any intervention, though they lacked a unified vision for their little nation.

Years became decades. Their numbers grew consistently.

Decades centuries. Their little towns had merged into one large town built on the mountain tops, prairies and hills.

Even with their idyllic society, the star children began to feel the absence left by the primordials. Though their memories had faded somewhat, they remembered the days of the good leaders.

Some explorers marched to the cave of prophecies, as they named the primordials retirement place, looking for their idols.

Many eagerly awaited the return of the primordials, but when the explorers returned, they brought back sad news.

*"We found the Primordials" -* said the young woman holding white tunics.  
*"That's great! Where are they?"* - said a voice among the crowd - *"Tom, why are you crying?"  
**"I... I am not crying"* - said a short man behind the girl holding the tunics - *"It just rained on my face."  
**"But... Where are they?" -* asked the crowd once more. Dread replaced the once palpable excitement.  
*"They... they passed away"* - replied Tom fighting the tears from rolling down.

The crowd murmured as they realised the meaning of those words.

*"That's not possible!"* - said the indistinguishable voice of an old man.  
*"Listen up people! Their bodies are gone, but they still reside in the cave"* - said the girl holding the tunics - *"At least their spirits are. They gave us a message for all of us. We can consult them at any point we want!"  
**"That's how they get you..."* - rambled a man at the edge of the road - *"... with all these consultancy jobs!"  
**"What are you talking about, Ed?"* - said a woman missing most of her teeth.  
*"I think consultants are people who take your watch so they can tell you what time is it, at a recurrent price!"* - said Ed convincingly.  
*"Oh, that's true..."* - said the general murmur of the crowd.  
*"People! Forget I said consult!"* - the girl dropped the tunics on the floor, partially due to frustration - *"What I meant is: if you need to talk, they will be there and provide... feedback."  
**"Oh, that's better..."* - Ed nodded with the new information.  
*"Yeah, I have a little bit of a pain in my lower back that needs some chec.."* - said a large-breasted woman, arching her back to relieve some of the pain.  
*"Spiritual feedback"* - clarified the explorer girl - *"They are not going to run things for us. That's our job now!"*

The crowd exchanged a series of doubtful looks. They wanted to find support in their numbers.

An old man, a shepherd of sorts, walked to the front of the crowd - *"You do not need someone wise and wrinkly to tell you what to do. You all can forge this country. No magic. No elites. Just the people."  
**"He is right!"* - said an old lady from the back of the crowd.  
*"If you want leaders to guide the nation forward, grow into the leaders you would like to follow"* - said the shepherd.  
*"That's smart! That is so smart!"* - the indistinguishable voice came from the crowd in general - *"This old man is so smart."  
**"So, how about if you lot talk to each other? I am sure we could make a nice future together"* - said the old shepherd with a hopeful tone.  
*"He is absolutely right!"* - said another voice among the many - *"Let the old man guide us as our leader!"  
**"... Uh? What?"* - replied the shepherd confused.  
*"Yeah, the wise man will be a good king!"* - said a loud man at the front of the pack.  
*"Me? Why me?"  
**"You are smart and wise!"* - said a woman holding a little girl.  
*"And... and... and wrinkly!"* - added the little girl whilst nodding to the people around.  
*"But I literally just said you don't need someone like..."  
**"He knows magic too! I seen it with my two very own eyes I got here in me skull!"* - yelled the town's beggar.  
*"You are not listening! I don't want to do this!"  
**"I mean, how could you say no? You are like a father to all of us!"* - the loud man had caught the crowd's attention - *"What do you say, people? Shall we get Pops to be our king?"*

A sea of chants called for the old shepherd, who found himself floating on the crowds' shoulders.

*"Put me down! I'll end up with dislocated hips!"* - growled the old shepherd - *"Fine! Fine! I'll do it, but put me down!"*

The crowd cheered.

*"But I have some conditions!" -* he pointed the staff at various motivators in the group - *"I will not be a king!"  
**"But you said you'll do it!"* - argued the town's jester.  
*"I'll just be a consu..."* - the shepherd stopped the phrase. A glance told him the man distrusting consultants was about to go off - *"an assistant to the people. No noble titles. No special treatment. Are we clear?"*

The murmur of the discussion filled the shepherd's ears until a woman raised her head from the group - *"Can we call you 'the supreme wise old man'?"*

*"That sounds silly. I don't want titles. Just call me by my name!"*

The people resumed their scrum, discussing the alternatives. The shepherd heard when one of them said - *"Of course, it is not Oldy-Mc-Shepherd."*

*Ah, there is the crux -* thought the shepherd - *they cannot remember my name*.

He opened his mouth to say it but restrained himself momentarily.

*"I've got it!"* - beamed the explorer girl - *"He will be our beloved Elder!"*

The shepherd thought about the generic term. He didn't quite like it, but he wasn't a big fan of bureaucracy. For all it matter, that term was enough - *"Ok, you all can just call me Father. I'll be the Elder of this land. Does that sound good?"*

Most nodded. The shepherd could see a few mumbling - *"Father? I thought about him like a great great great great great grandfather..."* - But he decided to ignore that, primarily because he still had some ego he wanted to protect. And secondly people were going to add more 'great' as time went on. It would become ridiculous at some point.

This was the birth of the realm of Dawn, even though Father protested to call it a realm as it implied certain monarchical ruling, he lost to the popular vote, and he was too old to fight the popular stubbornness.

Their realm expanded through the little planet. Every time the realm became too big to manage, Father, appointed a new elder to lead the land.

Each new realm had an intrinsic charm.

The realm of prairies was a sanctuary to all life.  
The realm of the hidden forest gave home to the runts, the hard workers, and rebels.  
The realm of triumph became a place of sportsmanship, competitiveness, and excellence.  
The realm of the golden city was the commercial hub of their world. It traded art, music, food and goods, not to mention a lot of merchants' sweat with every unloaded boat.  
The realm of knowledge, also known as the vault, became a place of science and magical exploration.

Their days overflowed with never-ending happiness and joy... though the never-ending part came to an end when shadows clouded their days.

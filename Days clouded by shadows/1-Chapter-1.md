# The Golden Wastelands

Have you wondered about the magic happening inside stars? These astonishing cosmic furnaces make the elements within us, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the light showering us daily. But the most mesmerising fact about them is:

For us to be alive, a star had to collapse in a cataclysmic death; releasing its contents forged over aeons into the void of space to drift as stardust until it rains down onto the realms. The only memory of their existence lays in us and its ghostly light travelling through space.

"*We are stardust, the Star Children, the descendants of the stars*" - said the first inhabitants of the realms of Sky.

The Star Children were a proud, gentle and noble race. They visited and set their presence on every realm; from Dawn to Mount Eden. They learnt from their environment, nourishing and flourishing from it.

They created temples dedicated to the creatures found on these lands, devoted their lives to understand the magic in the air. Every realm had a special candour making it unique but, only one of them attracted the attention of every Star Children: the city at the foot of Mount Eden, the Golden City.

The Golden City was, by far, the largest settlement of the Star Children, a place in which magic and technology intertwined to fill you with awe and wonder, gathering all the knowledge from every realm in its vault: the largest and most impressive collection of knowledge, stored on its (almost) infinite galleries, passages and libraries.

The city was described as a vast living organism: its people gave it rhythm, its temples, bridges and ports gave it structure. Merchants covered every single corner with their tents and goods. Scholars discussing high magic, tradesman and warriors in constant migration. The city had a permanent murmur, a kerfuffle to settle, a loud merchant to quiet down, a musician on a very big horse with Peter-Panny-king-of-boots trying to woo a lady, explorers trying to reach new realms. It was unruly chaos... or should've been unruly to anybody but the Warrior, an elder guiding the armies of the Star Children and custodian of the realm.

The Golden City was a coastal city filled to the brim with temples, naval ports, shops, trading spots and wizarding schools. It was surrounded by the sea, protected by its great walls; walls built to endure the strongest storms the realms had to throw at them... Or the mightiest army, though conflicts were rare among the Star Children. The Golden City was a fortress and a collection of temples; a maze to protect its precious treasures of magic and knowledge.

And you would assume its name "Golden City" was derived from its precious contents and treasures, a common misconception among visitors until the first light of the day shone on them. A warm light, showering you at all times coming from the light bounced from the domes and golden cornices of the temples.

Some travellers called it Dusk because it seemed like time froze at sunset in the Golden City, regardless of the time of the day. A jewel among the realms, except for the citadel of Eden.

But everybody knew what the Golden City looked like. Everybody had been within its massive walls whilst few had been to the citadel of Eden, it was reserved to those illuminated/wise enough to conquer the knowledge stored in the vaults of the Golden City.

The citadel of Eden was, to most of the Star Children, a myth or a fairy tale, a mirage of a city above the Golden City. On the other hand, the Golden City was a testament to endurance, a city that could outlast time itself.

Yet, nobody could've ever predicted its downfall would emerge from the mirage above it. An explosion made everyone look towards Eden in terror, as they noticed the mount hosting the most splendid citadel was spewing flames, detritus and rocks up to the sky. The citadel had disappeared behind a column of flames and fire; descending from it, dark shadows moved at speed toward the Golden City, engulfing everything on its path.

The elders witnessed first-hand what had happened in that fateful morning. Darkness had appeared in the citadel and it was making its way to the realm below.

The elders managed to escape their initial encounter and rushed out of the vault to warn others. They were distressed but they needed to command the inhabitants of the Golden City to prepare for what was coming.

The Wise, the elder of the vault, looked back. She told the Warrior she needed to go back and close the gates to Eden. Though he didn't want to let her go, the Warrior understood and called every guard, warrior and fighter he could summon to prepare for battle. They were going to reclaim Eden and protect the city from the darkness descending upon them.

The Collector summoned the mantas, whales and other light creatures to help in the fight whilst the other elders organised every soul in the city to leave it behind, seeking shelter.

The music within the city had quiet down. The ongoing murmur was nothing but a memory. Time had gone still.

The first signs of the oncoming darkness appeared when the air became dense and the sea started to retreat. The sweet and salty breeze turned into a strong wind with an unpleasant stench. Ships capped on its side as the retreating water left them stranded.

The warriors prepared to fend off the darkness.

The wind became heavy and thick with haze. The dry sea bed left exposed. The smell of decay filled every gulp of air the warriors could take.

And for a few instants, there was silence. Just a gentle, rhythmic drumming could be heard. The heart of each fighter was beating in unison.

The silence was interrupted by a roar coming from below as the ground started to rumble. It grew in intensity and shook every building, wall and soul.

Walls of temples and shops cracked.

Bridges collapsed under their weight as the earthquake ravaged the city.

Gazebos swelled by the now abundant sand.

The warriors waited. The earthquake was easing out but they could hear the destruction coming their way. They tighten their grip on their weapons and shields.

No natural disaster could compare to what was about to happen.

As rocks fell from the sky and crashed through buildings and ships, dragons descended from above clashing with the warriors, sending many flying off. The Collector accompanied by wizards and scholars, took to the sky mounted on whales, mantas, king jellyfish and the coelacanth to balance the battle on their favour. Every dragon they took down melted in the waters, turning the sand into toxic mud, the waters into poison and changing little creatures into dark critters. There was no end in sight to the hordes descending from Eden.

One by one ours protectors flounder, warriors had spread thin through the battlefield in an attempt to control the chaos devouring the once vibrant city. The mighty light creatures littered the battleground with their bodies.

The Collector left with some survivours, instructed by the Warrior. They were fighting a losing battle.

From the entrance to the vault, the Warrior stepped in, wounded and filled with despair turned to take one last look to his beloved city:

A city now void of life, poisonous waters and thick toxic air with a permanent green haze; everything dear to him was now a wasteland. Giving unsteady steps, he managed to return to his throne, decides it is time to lay his flame to save those who managed to escape and trap the darkness within the broken walls of the desolated city.

Pointing his spear to the skies, he turned his spirit into a spark so bright that it flashed through every realm. Even though the darkness was unleashed upon the realms, this soon-to-be-forgotten land was going to be now its prison.

It was known as the last flare of the Golden City and the birth of the Golden Wasteland.

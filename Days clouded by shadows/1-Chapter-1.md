# The Golden Wastelands

Stars are kind of amazing, aren't they? All sorts of magic happen inside of them, from giving off warmth to squeezing all the elements in existence from just gas. Many would like to have the skill of turning their gas into valuables, though theirs wouldn't be primarily hydrogen.

In any case, those astonishing cosmic furnaces cook up the elements within us; the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the light cascading on us.

One of the most mesmerising facts about them is:  
For us to be alive a star had to suffer a horrible death.  
In its final moment, the star collapsed past a certain point, fusing heavier and heavier elements until it could not do it further. The entire compression fuels the largest bounce in the multiverse, shredding itself into pieces, and releasing its forged contents into the cosmos.  
It would take eons for the stardust to drift aimlessly through the emptiness of space, and rain down on little planets.  
The only memory of their existence would remain in the ghostly light travelling through the vastness of spacetime.

"*We are stardust, the Star Children. The descendants of the stars*" - said the first inhabitants of the realms of this little world... or that is how historians wrote it to make it sound more poetic.

The Star Children were a proud, gentle and noble race. They were born from the remanent of the stellar birth, quite literally plasma that found its way down on a little planet, mixed with the planet's components and emerged as winged people.

They were explorers and wanderers, a detail that helped them to colonise every island, continent, mountain and sea on their little planet. They learnt from their environment, nourishing and flourishing from it.  
Their exploration resulted in the establishment of multiple realms across the globe.

They erected temples dedicated to the creatures found on these lands and devoted their lives to understanding the magic floating in the air. Every realm had some special candour making it unique, but only one of them attracted the attention of every Star Children: the city at the foot of Mount Eden, the Golden City.

The Golden City was by far the largest settlement of the Star Children, a place in which magic, technology, religion, and indigestion intertwined to fill you with awe, wonder and gastritis.  
A place in which knowledge naturally congregated in its vault: the largest and most impressive collection of knowledge, stored in its (almost) infinite galleries, passages and libraries.

Visitors and merchants would describe the metropolis as a vast living organism because its people gave it rhythm; its temples, bridges and ports gave it structure.  
Merchants covered every single corner with their tents and goods. Scholars discuss high magic, tradesman and warriors in constant migration.  
Cooks used to flood the streets with the aroma of their cooking. Cooks like Billy and his famous Bart's all-you-can-eat became a restaurant chain. Every resident of the Golden City knew these restaurants. They all call it Bart's all-you-don't-want-to-eat.

The city had a permanent murmur, a kerfuffle to settle, a loud merchant to quiet down, a musician on a very big horse with Peter-Panny-king-of-boots trying to woo a lady, explorers trying to reach new realms.  
It was unruly chaos... or should've been unruly to anybody but the Warrior, the ruler and guide of the armies of the Star Children and custodian of the realm. He was a tall and strong man for a big and strong city. And it was easy for him to keep peace in the city; he was substantially stronger than anybody else and he was a giant among the Star Children.

The Golden City was a coastal city filled to the brim with temples, shops, trading spots, wizarding schools, tall residential buildings, towers, forts and naval ports.

It was a city surrounded by the sea, protected by its great walls; walls built to endure savage storms thrown at the realm... Or the mightiest army, though conflicts were rare among the Star Children.  
The Golden City was a fortress with an inexhaustible collection of temples. A maze to protect its precious treasures of magic and knowledge.

And you could assume its name "Golden City" was derived from its highly-priced contents and treasures, a common misconception among visitors until the first light of the day shone on them. The warm light would shower the gold-covered domes and cornices on every temple, reflecting it on the semi-white walls around it, painting the city in the lustrous colour.

The Island's original dwellers thought the 'Golden City' was too pompous. At that time, the city had a few hundred temples adorning the landscape. A few years later, the peaceful area grew packed with temples, to the point you could stray from one temple into the next without realising it.

Travellers called the expanding city: Dusk because it appeared like time had stopped at sunset regardless of the time of the day. The inhabitants liked the name Dusk, but it did not stick with the general population. I mean, it was a city, and it was golden. What else could you call it?

Despite the unimaginative name, the city was breathtaking with its exuberant beauty and unique atmosphere. It attracted a neverending stream of tourists from every corner of the little planet.

No other site could compete with it, except for the citadel of Eden. But that comparison was hard to establish; the citadel rested out of reach of your everyday Joe. Only the enlightened, academics and those who spent a considerable chunk of their lives reading about magic were given access past its walls.

Eden was a myth, a fairy tale, a mirage about the Golden City.  
On the other hand, the Golden City was a collection of strongholds impossible to erase from the planet. Given enough time, the city would outlast time itself.

Yet, nobody could have ever predicted its downfall would emerge from the mirage above it.

The day began like any other day. Merchants tried to sell two boxes for the price of three; musicians distracted the tourists whilst monks became friends with their possessions. Priests convinced the poor to give them money in exchange for eternal salvation.

The city pulsed with the rhythm of its people until a tremor, strong enough to quiet down its streets, shook it to the core.

The city watched the keep for ten long minutes. They wondered what was behind the streams of smoke hiding the keep above the clouds.

*"Whass-oing-on?"* - said the woken-up drunkard, checking his pockets in case one of the monks had walked past. His blurred vision and uncoordinated coordination disappeared after the following tremor violently shook the city.

Few stood still watching the mountain top. Most panicked immediately.  
Few saw the explosion's blast approaching, sending the unprepared against walls, stands, or windows. The mount spewed flames, detritus and rocks miles above the clouds. The sky had turned deep red.

The terror had taken every aspect, every soul living in the Golden City. They ran towards the nearest temple, finding them unsafe as their columns had cracked, their ceilings dusting the floors.

The Golden armies began to show their rigorous training. Even though their flames trembled with nervousness, they organised parties to scout the collapsed buildings and rescue those trapped under the rubble.

*"Bloody-ell. What's that?!"* - said an old man getting escorted by one of the guards.  
The bulky guard followed the finger of the old man towards streams of darkness streaming down the mountain top. The stream moved unnaturally fast, consuming everything on its path, making its way towards the Vault's passage leading to Eden.  
He felt his guts squeeze themselves. It was a clear message, and it was not a good one - *"Men to the Vault! Quick! Go to Vault!"*

Closer to the Vault's passage to Eden, the elders reviewed the sequence of events leading them to seek refuge in the Vault. They witnessed firsthand the appearance of the darkness in the citadel, a secret that remained with the elders as the turmoil took over.

The scholars rummaged through books in the Vault's chambers, but they saw the Elders rush towards the Vault's entrance, where the top brass had gathered, awaiting to the Warrior to impart the news.

*"Atteeeeeeention!"* - the heavily decorated man saluted vigorously to the Warrior. Some of the medals rested horizontally on his belly.  
The Warrior gave him a look overflowing with disdain. He had tried to change the armies, but adulation and repetitive actions with your arms followed by the loud tapping of your hills were deeply engrained in their brain - *"At ease, all of you. Especially you, Bob."*

A lad on the first row lowered his prosthetic arm.

*"Sir! We came as soon as possible, sir!"* - replied the decorated man. His voice carried expectation, almost enquiring about the recent events without a single word. Eventually, he added - *"We saw something running down the hills towards the Vault, sir!"*

*"Good"* - said the Warrior dismissively. He fought to organise his thoughts. It did not help the decorated man stared intently at him - *"Anything else, general Jollygut?"*

*"The lads await your commands, sir!"* - said the general.

*"Oh, yes!"* - the Warrior looked at the golden armies assembled outside Vault's gates - *"Tell them to start digging trenches. We will need barricades. Bring more fighters. Men, women... anybody with the skills to hold a lance, spear, javelin, and shield. We will need all the help we can get."*

*"... But sir... Are we getting ready to battle?"*

*"No, General. We are getting ready for war. Now go! There is no time to waste!"* - firmly said the Warrior, watching the general salute whilst his medals bounced off his belly. The general turned on his feet and marched towards the golden army - *"And send an eagle to the barbarians! They are excellent with those long swords... Where is Weasel?"*

*"Down here, your immense grace!" -* said a thin woman with sleek grey wings wearing a tight brown leather jacket and bone shades strapped to her head - *"Chief Weasel reporting for duty! Sir!"*

*"Why the formality, Weasel?"* - he raised an eyebrow, hidden by his helmet.

*"Dunno... the fat man seemed to enjoy it" -* she said with a vile smirk.

The Warrior and Weasel had a history together. They were what you could call siblings from another mother - *"Are the men ready to take off?"*

*"The men? Maybe... All men are lazy on the job. The girls are already up in the air!"* - she liked to piss him off. To her surprise, it didn't work.

*"Good. When those things arrive, I don't want them leaving the city's airspace. Push them down. Let the ground troops finish the job."*

*"Aye..."* - she raised an eyebrow - *"Could I ask what is this 'them' we are talking about?"*

The Warrior trusted Weasel, but he doubted a second before opening his mouth. The second was enough to allow the opportune interruption of a person behind the Warrior, who dwarfed him in size.

The massive hand reached out, grabbing the Warrior's right pauldron. The tinted light drew the contour of the Collector's face, the Elder of the Prarie fields and the Sanctuary Islands - *"I am summoning all the creatures of light. Shall I call your manta?"*

The Warrior looked down at Weasel's face, then back at the smoke rising above the city. It would be hard to control the armies without a proper view of the battlefield - *"Yes, Billy. Thank you."*

The Collector stuck his massive fingers in his mouth, and he whistled. The sound overpowered the noise of the armies preparing the improvised battlefield. Within seconds, the flying whales emerged from the sea, followed by flying mantas of all sizes and colours, and finally, the great coelacanth, which landed majestically in front of the Collector.

The golden armies paused their rhythmic shovelling. It was a rare sight to appreciate the splendour of the mythical creature protecting the Collector. Once he had mounted behind its head, the Collector clicked his tongue, sending the eighty metres long creature up in the air where it would join the squadrons circling above the Vault's entrance.

The Warrior watched Weasel join her squadron when the tapping of Father's staff caught his attention - *"My son, Grace and I will organise the exodus of those seeking shelter."*

The Warrior watched the Elder of the Hidden Forest, walk past him chasing the old shepherd. She made apologetic movements with her hand as her hammer hit the Warrior on the ribs.

*"Miss Wise! There has been a breach on the top level!"* - said a wizardy-looking scholar from the reinforced gate of the Vault.

*"Who is there?"* - said the Wise as she began to march back to the inner chambers of the Vault, but she came to a stop when the Warrior grabbed her arm - *"Wait, I'll come!"*

She glanced at the armies behind the Warrior - *"Viktor, your people need you, and so does mine."*

*"But I swore to protect you!"*

She extended her arm to caress his face. She gave him the same sweet look she had used in the past, the one that goes through any kind of armour, melting awat its protective nature like butter - *"And you have very much done s..."*

He did not like the sound of those words because they left an awful taste in his mouth - *"Rumpus!"* - the shout made the Wise waggle whilst retrieving her hand.

*"Yessir!"* - said a man wearing light armour and a belt with half a dozen knives.

*"Rumpus, fetch some of your best men."*

*"Yessir, right away!" - the man swivelled on his feet - "Sergeant Chicken! Sergeant Wuss! And Captain Skidhpants!"*

The three individuals filtered gracefully through the battlefield, avoiding shovels, spears and large wooden rods covered in barbed wire. They stopped in front of their superior, though the traditional salute used by the army was absent.

*"They're here, sir!" -* said Major Rumpus.

The Warrior thoroughly examined the newcomers, though he excused one of the newcomers as he wanted to appear respectful of the voluptuous lass.

*"Rumpus..."* - said the Warrior almost in a murmur - *"Did you say Chicken?"*

*"Yessir!"*

*"And Wuss..."*

*"Yessir!"*

*"And Skidmarks"*

*"Nosir! She is Skidhpants, sir! With an 'h' after the 'd', sir!"*

The Warrior examined the phonetic differences - *"I see... And these are the best we have, do we?"*

*"The finest, sir!" - Major Rumpus looked satisfied at his men... and woman.*

*"Are they brave?"*

*"Courageous, sir!"*

*"What about this Chicken?"*

*"Very plucky man, sir!"*

*"And Wuss?"*

*"Spunky, sir!"*

*"What about Skid..."*

Major Rumpus interrupted the Warrior, suspecting a mistake was about to be made - *"Skidhpants, sir! I trust my life to her, sir. She inspired others to follow her, sir!"*

Slam!

The Wise used the distraction to close the heavy gates without making any sound.

*"Mika, what are you doing?"* - the Warrior ran his hands over the cold exterior of the gate, searching for a latch or a handle.

*"The darkness must be about to overflow on the city. It would be negligent on our part to be in a single place"* - the crystal pendant hanging off the Warrior's neck projected the Wise's voice - *"It is time to put our duties above our personal life. Protect the people here. We will seal the darkness before it consumes everything."*

In frustration, he swung his arm against the solid gate. It shook on the spot but did not cave in.

Major Rumpus heard the faint whisper the Warrior uttered - *"Sir? What shall we do, sir?"*

The Warrior descended the visor of his helmet before turning around, grabbing his shield and spear, and yelling at the masses - *"I'll buy a pint of beer per each dark dragon hunt down! Or a kick on your arse for every single one that escapes!"* - his voice carried angry encouragement.

The golden army cheered loudly, though they mostly cheered out of fear the Warrior would start kicking their bottoms.

Their cheers were the only sounds rippling through the city. Every other noise had quieted down.

The ongoing murmur was nothing but a memory.

Time had gone still outside the immediacy of the Vault.

The first sign of the oncoming darkness was the heaviness of the air.

The sea slowly retreated, taking the sweet and salty breeze.

Then the wind picked up, bringing an unpleasant stench. Ships capsized as the disappearing water left them stranded.

The exposed dry sea bed made the stench worse. The taste of every gulp of air made the warriors wrinkle their faces and cover their noses.

And for a few instants, there was silence.

Just gentle, rhythmic drumming. The heart of each fighter beat in unison.

A tempo shattered by roars of beasts coming from above.

Roars increased in intensity with every passing second, shaking buildings, walls, ruins and souls.

The constant rumble changed into a tremor. Walls of temples cracked, and shops fell.

Bridges collapsed under their weight as the earthquake ravaged the city.

Gazebos swelled by the now abundant sand.

The armies awaited.

The earthquake died out, but the sound of destruction coming their way didn't.

They tightened the grip on their weapons and shields.

Rocks fell from the sky, crashing through buildings and ships.

Dragons descended from the streams of smoke, clashing with the warriors, sending many flying off.

The Collector fought alongside the Warrior and the airborne squadrons in an attempt to balance the tide of the war in their favour, but it was futile.

Every dragon they took down melted in the waters, turning them poisonous.

Every dragon caught between the lances and spears of the golden army turned into toxic sand.

For every dragon they beat, six more would appear from above.

The Warrior saw how each of the fighters floundered due to the fatigue of battling for days. He saw how the forces had spread paper-thin through the battlefield whilst the darkness devoured the once vibrant city.

He saw the battleground, littered with the bodies of the creatures of light, thousands of bodies of those trying to protect the innocents trapped in the devastation.

He understood that they were fighting a losing battle.

*"Warrior!"* - called the Collector on top of his coelacanth covered in acidic black goo, burning through its calcified exterior - *"There are no more survivors in the city. Just tired fighters, soldiers and mercenaries. We won't last long..."*

The Warrior observed the remains of his beloved flying manta, laying lifeless. It fought valiantly, he was sure of it - *"Go home, Billy. Find the other elders. Tell them we tried, but the darkness will spread."*

*"... Warrior"* - the Collector tried to argue, but the Warrior interrupted him.

*"Viktor... Call me Viktor"* - said the Warrior analysing the path leading to the Vault - *"It is time for you to go, Billy."*

The Collector nodded whilst hiding his tears. Despite being such a large man, he was a child.

The coelacanth flapped its six pairs of flippers, promptly gaining speed, leaving the desolated metropolis behind whilst heading to the highlands and Triumph's snowy peaks.

The Warrior stumbled as he tried to walk, leaning on the nearest wall of a ruin. He pushed himself straight to proceed with his walk towards the Vault, leaving the bloody print of his hand on the wall.

He had never felt despair, and he thought he would never know the feeling of it. That was days ago. By now, he had become more than acquainted with it.

Each step was agony and bloodloss took the better of him. He didn't care about physical pain, but it hurt so much to look at his beloved city in a state of utter nothingness. The city was now void of life, covered in a permanent green haze. It all was nothing more than a wasteland.

Determination kept him from resting on the ground, waiting for death to show up. Though, his motivation had the name, Mika.

His hands reached the gears of the barbican separating the battleground and the true entrance of the Vault. It took some effort, but he pushed the gears enough to let him in.

His throne shone across the room. The ceiling creaked, complaining about the inclement siege of the dragons trying to break in.

His hands searched the cord of his necklace, pulling the pendant out. And he watched it for two whole minutes - *"Hey girl, do you remember the day you wanted me to learn magic? I remember it almost like it was this morning. You said it was easy to make rain clouds to draw rainbows over the city. The next thing we know, the candles in our room melted away with the fog I had created, and our noses tingled like crazy... I think it is time to make the biggest rainbow I can make over the city."*

He looked up. The ceiling had an opening caused by the dragons ramming their heads to breach in.

The Warrior smiled, grabbed the leftovers of his spear, and pointed it towards the cloud-covered night sky. The flame on his chest flared up, it burned his spirit to amplify the little magical skill he had. The spell would cost his life, but it would be worth it.

It sparked a stream of light that flashed through every realm, and when it touched the clouds, it formed a ceiling of corrosive gas that expanded city-wide, covering the soon-to-be-forgotten land.

He turned the city into a prison the darkness would never escape.

His sacrifice was known as the last flare of the Golden City, and the birth of the Golden Wasteland.

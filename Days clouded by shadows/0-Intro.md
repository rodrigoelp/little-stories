# What is this?

This story is dedicated to its inspiration, a game called "Sky: children of the light".

It is a meaningful and beautiful game, filled with diverse and rich visual content, yet it lacks an explicit storytelling element, that fundamental thread reeling you in. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it enables others (like yours truly) to idealise this little confabulation.

The inspiration crystallised into the descriptions of the realms, followed by dreams and the need to share the ether required to fill up the gaps, providing a deeper meaning to the sacrifice the inhabitants perform as they continue their journey and grow closer to friends.

I guess I am saying, this is my thank you note to you, the team inspired me to refine my attributes and skills. They imbued the desire to become a good writer or storyteller. Though let's be honest, I'll be far from anybody recognisable for their talent.

I shared these ideas with others gaining new perspectives about reframing my imagination to engage others. It was fuel to my delusional mind.

*To those of you sharing your love*: **Thank you,** you gave me the motivation to make this public.

*To future readers*: **Thank you.** The time spent reading my words and ideas will be deeply and dearly appreciated, even if you don't share a comment back.

*To critics*: if you share any feedback; positive or negative, it will help me to organise my thoughts and to tune my senses. It helps me to become better.

I hope you enjoy it.

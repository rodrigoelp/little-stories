# What is this?

There is this little game called "Sky: children of the light" which has lots of meaning and content behind it, yet it lacks a story to thread the environments you visit. Inspired in its beautiful story and content, I decided to write these stories to fill up the gaps left by the original creators, providing a deeper meaning to the sacrifice the inhabitants perform as they continue their journey and grow closer to friends.

This is a sort of thank you for inspiring me yet, I lack so many attributes to be a good writer or storyteller. However, I already shared these ideas with others, gained perspective that keeping ideas to myself keeps me locked in a world in which I will continue to doubt if I have anything others might be interested.

To those of you sharing your love: Thank you, you provided motivation to make this public.

To future readers: Thank you, your time spent reading my words and ideas is dearly appreciated, even if you don't share a comment back.

To critics: Thank you as well, positive and negative feedback helps others organise their train of thoughts and tune the senses.

Hope you enjoy it.

# Daylight Prairie

All these lands have been bountiful and proper before there was any star falling on the realms. Aeons had shaped life, adapted it to float on the air or swim on its oceans and sea; nourish from the light of its nearby star.

When the first Star Children descended upon these lands, they found a sanctuary filled with creatures teaching them how to coexist, in harmony with the wind, the mountains, the clouds and the oceans. To many, this was a piece of heaven and Prairie was by a long shot, the most beautiful realm they have set foot on.

Paradoxically, the realm of Praire has many ecosystems; very few are actual prairies. Its coasts receive mantas all around, evergreen fields and gentle slopes give an illusion of a relatively big savanna covered with a soft blanket of clouds but, in reality, what you see are the tip of the mountains below.

The first elders searching for a new home past the shores of Dawn arrived here and perplexed by the beauty and richness in here, decided the home of the mantas, should be the home of the Star Children. The environment welcomed them, fuelled their spirits and cleaned their flames.

Over time the realm grew, temples appeared in various places.

The inhabitants were happy but, the initial splendour of these lands had fallen short from the first days of the Star Children. Father knew, a protected needed to be designated, someone in sync with nature and life itself.

*"Who could be better to look after this oasis of life?"* - thought Father Elder whilst observing each of the Star Children around him. His gaze landed on a gentle giant, a kid playing with a light butterfly.

*"What are you doing my child?"* - said Father.

*"The wind knocked it off the flower. I am making sure it is OK!"* - said the gentle spirit. Father smiled and knew he had found the one he was looking for.

The Collector was a small child in his soul though he was a giant otherwise. His size and sluggishness hide his smart attitude and cleverness. He was an avid user of magic, developed a technique to restrain the light on each spirit, allowing it to inspect any creature without any harm.

The elders had no problem receiving the Collector into their ranks; he had a character very difficult to ignore, attracting any sort of life to himself.

Even though his personality was hard to ignore, he had no trouble ignoring everybody else, his gaze wandered away from conversations, following mantas, whales or the sporadic butterfly. He would have been called "the Distracted" but, the elders noticed his methodical approach about learning of the environments. His temple was filled with magical jars, containing all sorts of butterflies and other creatures, resting and healing under the caring supervision of its guardian.

He was an adept builder too and ingenious at it as well. Villagers wanted temples dedicated to the mantas: he built three of them with bells to summon their companionship.

Villagers wanted to nourish the birds and the butterflies, so he built floating islands and set their nests on each of them.

He was at his happiest when the mantas visited the village, in a playful display of their skills. He wanted to be one with the mantas but, due to his size and lack of athletic skills, he never mastered the required knowledge to take to the skies.

However, this was never a problem. The mantas and whales learnt to pick him up and, in an almost telepathic relationship, take him wherever he needed to go. He was an Elder like no other.

One day, the Collector noticed Father's arrival whilst he was rolling down the hill, playing with an exotic new creature.

*"Hi, Father!"* - said the Collector.

*"A new creature of light?"* - inquired Father.

*"Not sure. It chewed my petunias and I don't think it absorbs light. I call it Oreo"* - replied the Collector continuing playing with the black and white puppy.

Father looked at the floor, Collector's crystal was buzzing. *"Say, are you coming?"* asked rhetorically.

*"Wha? What do you mean coming? Where are we going?"* replied the Collector.

*"We have been summoned, my child."* - said Father. *" Wise discovered something amusing and wants us to see it with her."*

The Collector sat looking down at the village. *"But I got a job to do here..."* He turned around and noticed Father's solemn mask *"but... I guess, I better grab my things and come, we will finish swiftly and I will come back in a jiffy. I'll take Oreo somewhere he can't get in trouble and we'll be on our way."*

He stood up and summoned his mantas and marched to the Golden City. Whales, king jellyfish, mantas, birds and butterflies marched with him.

Their passage through settlements was joyful and astonishing to many. Maybe this was the reason why every elder used to say the Collector can't be concealed easily. It wasn't because of his size but rather the huge flock of creatures guarding him and transporting him as precious cargo.

The Golden City inhabitants received the gentle creatures and whilst the elders ascended to Eden, they took good care of every one of them. At least until the mountain erupted and the ground shook.

The Collector descended out of the Vault arguing with Father Elder

*"... but they could get harm!"* said the Collector.

*"Son, look at the destruction they have caused. Ask your creatures to join in this fight..."* - negotiated Father.

*"How can I ask the whales, mantas, everyone, to fight them off?"*

Father made him come to reason: if they didn't fight there, the corruption was going to spread to every realm.

The Collector hugged his whales and mantas. Their hearts were connected and signalled him back it was OK. He hopped on the coelacanth and took off to the skies.

The battle was as fierce on the ground as it was in the air. Dragons flowed from Eden like a black stream swallowing everything on its path.

Warriors had trouble facing the dragons and its armoured bodies; the coelacanth, on the other hand, was on par with the dragons, Its armoured body could take most of the blows as they rammed dragons. But the dragons were tougher.

The Collector held his position as long as he could, pain brewing in his heart. So many of his loved creatures had perished, spread over the ruins of the Golden City, their carcasses showed the brutal battle.

He looked down at the battlefield nears the Warrior's temple, most of the Star Children laid on the ground, slowly turning into stone. The Warrior gave him a signal to leave the grounds and as he caught up with Father a flash of light rose from the Warrior's temple, dividing the sky in two. With sorrow, he joined the escort of those leaving to safer realms.

First, they reached the snowy peaks near the Citadel of Triumph. He was tired and beaten. Father was in bad shape as well.

Filled with pain and sadness, he embraced the coelacanth, it hummed softly and drifted slowly towards the Hidden Forest.

The closer they were to their sacred realms, the stronger the Collector felt venom flowing inside of him, spreading slowly. He could see it flowing through the air, the water and the land.

He knew the time of the Star Children was about to conclude. His light was extinguishing slowly and the darkness seemed unstoppable now.

They arrived at Prairie with the rest of his light creatures, Father and all the refugees from various realms. The Collector could sense the flow of life around him and he knew every Star Children had been polluted with the darkness, fear and sadness.

Their destiny was about to end but there was a way to stop this catastrophe to take everything down with them.

Father had noticed the wandering mind of the Collector; he knew his thoughts well. Before he embarked on his last journey with every child he could find, asked the Collector to wait one more night.

The night seemed to stretch every minute into hours. The stars drifted on their curved path until the sun rose and came down as always does, the Collector, the elder so fond of life was the one responsible for ending the flame of every Star Children.

He waited until every single flame was asleep, then enchanting one jar, opened it, letting it sucked in the light out of the chest of every single one of them. The flames flared up in the air, turned into little butterflies and zoomed in the jar. His grip was tight and his tears rolled down his mask.

The giant jar, rolled away from his cold hands, drifting slowly as one final butterfly left the Collector's chest. His body turned to stone, laid next to it in a sleep-like state: in a gentle but long-lasting dream about the daylight of Prairie.

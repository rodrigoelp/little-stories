# Epologue

A dark tall robed figure was sitting on a rock and observed Father stretch an arm looking for his staff.

*"Oh, my dear children. I hope they make it"* - Father said still rubbing his fingers through the sand.

Something was not right. For one, his fingers seemed to be touching the sand but the sensation wasn't there. Through the corner of his eyes, he noticed the dark figure lurking in the deep of the night.

*"Are you the darkness?"* - Father said.

NO - replied the figure.

*"What are you doing there?"*

WATCHING

*"Have you seen my staff?"* - replied Father dismissing the stranger as safe to be around.

I HAVE SEEN THE STAFF. IT IS NOT AROUND HERE - replied the figure.

Father noticed, the figure was not talking, its voice was booming straight into his head.

*"I thought I just died, didn't I?"* - replied Father.

NOT DEAD BUT YOU ARE NO MORE, YOU ARE EX FATHER. JUST REFORMED - explained the figure, standing up and extending its scythe, the sharp blade sparkled as if stars were trapped in its metal, the edge of the blade was so sharp that could split atoms and so thin you could almost see through it.

*"I don't like the look of your staff... seems dangerous"* - said Father fixated on the blade.

IT IS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL - replied the tall figure.

*"But seems like someone can get hurt, or they can cut themselves!"*

AND IT WOULD BE A VALUABLE LESSON TO LEARN - replied the figure as two blue stars glowed on each eye socket. Father could feel the figure was smiling.

*"I guess, you have come to take me with you, am I right?"*

I CAME TO GUIDE YOU - Death swang the scythe cutting the thin fabric of space. Its bony fingers stretched into the slit, revealing a new environment filled with light.

Father walked in, he could see a blanket of stars under his feet that swayed like ripples on water. Stars floating above his head. *"Wow, this is gorgeous. What is this realm?"*

NOT A REALM, IT IS A PLACE BETWEEN LIFE AND... NO LIFE. WE ARE ABOVE IT. IN ORBIT ABOVE IT.

*"Father, is that you?"* - said the Smith followed by the Twins. Father's flame beat intensely, or something that should have been his flame.

*"Oh my. You are all here! I see you have been giving some rough love to the Twins"* - continued looking at the Twins holding their ribs after a bone crushing bear hug - *"and the Wise has checked Warrior is not missing any teeth..."*

*"Twice!"* - replied the Warrior.

*"I believe this is yours..."* - said the Collector handing over the staff - *"It floated here from the shore."*

*"We saw your sacrifice, some of us saw the sacrifice every one of us did, but we can't see the little ones"* - said the Wise.

Father closed his eyes in an attempt to see the realms. He could see the shore of Dawn, the peaks of Triumph, and the dunes of Wasteland. *"Why can't I see the little ones?"* - said Father turning to face Death.

I DO NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS - Death replied apologetically - I AM A VISITOR OF THESE PARTS. I CAN GUESS THE CHILDREN ARE SOMEWHERE SAFE WAITING THE CALL TO FIGHT BACK.

Father's grip tightens on his staff. His focus sharpening on his inner sight. A little island filled with floating cocoons appeared. *"They are safe. I can feel them"*.

The elders rejoiced, the little children of the light were getting stronger.

Death turned around, walking towards a glowing gate gathering stars; Father followed and asked - *"Are you leaving?"*

YES, MY HORSE NEEDS FEEDING AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER MIGHT BE GETTING IN TROUBLE. I SHALL HEAD BACK.

*"But where are you going?"*

BACK WHERE I BELONG, I FIND THE LACK OF TURTLES AND ELEPHANTS UNCOMFORTING

*"We have lots of mantas"*

DO THEY CARRY DISCS ON THEIR BACK?

*"No..."*

THEN I SHALL HEAD BACK

Father looked at the tall figure and noticed his robe had different shades of black, a perfectly smooth fabric with depth beyond the actual fabric. Death waited a few seconds and extended its hand. Father shook it up.

*"What will we do without Death on the realms?"* - Father said.

I GUESS EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO BE REBORN

Father turned around to look at his family and the stars high above them. *"How do you think we should summon the kids?"* asked, looking at the elders.

HOW ABOUT 'HEY SLACKERS, TIME TO WORK' - said Death peeking beyond the gate.

*"That would be a tad offensive..." -* argued Father

'HEY YOU, YOU ARE FINALLY AWAKE. YOU WERE TRYING TO CROSS THE BORDER...' - replied Death suggestively.

*"It doesn't feel like it belongs on their story" -* said Father waving his hands, trying to imagine their reaction.

THEN HOW ABOUT *'WAKE UP, CHILD. BRING OUR LOST STARS HOME'*? - said the figure disappearing into the gate.

*"I like that... I do like the sound of that"* - said Father leaning on his staff, waiting for the day the light returns to the realms of Sky.

# Hidden Forest

Beyond the beautiful nature of Prairie lays a forest deep between the mountains, a natural fortress hiding in plain view protecting everything it enters its domain. Its lush foliage and tall trees create a permanent mist that covers the sun and the canopies, isolating the realm from the view of those seeking its inhabitants from above.

Aeons ago, in the time of the first Elders, explorers stepped on these lands for the first time they ventured into this forest and settled in, making homes out of the trees and some times inside of the tree itself.

They fed on the light of its vegetation that learnt to provide its own light due to the absence of the sun. The water condenses out the bark, flowing down into rivers, ponds and creeks.

The first elders would come to past; new generations of guides would arrive, to expand this realm keeping its mesmerising beauty secret from the sky above.

Some guides were wise whilst others were kind. Eventually, an Elder with a strong personality and a temper many avoided witnessing, the Smith was chosen to rule the forest.

She used to look at the forest and always wondered - *How did I become the guarding of these lands?*

She looked at the quiet and soothing forest. She felt the gentle breeze on her body. All of it was the complete opposite of her personality. She loved the anvil and the hammer. She felt thrilled with the sparks of forging nature itself into whatever she pleased. She was the embodiment of fearlessness.

Even though the forest did not represent her usual emotions, she was truly a creature of this realm, knew every cave, chasm and hollow tree. She could sprint from temple to temple in a whiff. She was in perfect harmony with the elements and the forest responded to her.

Well, it wasn't just nature responding to her will, the inhabitants responded to her without her having to say a word.

Father had seen her grow into a fine woman, skilled and curious. An excellent scientist balancing the magic of the place with her science, though there was an aspect she lacked, Father thought, she needed to let go of her commanding figure and become someone accessible.

Years went past, and she grew distant from others. Father found a perfect solution to this problem. He had found two small children in need of discipline and a host needed to connect to her feelings.

*"A perfect coincidence these babies were going to warm the heart of the Smith"* - he said. Everyone knew the twins were too much for him to handle and the Smith could crush stones just by looking at it, these babies were not going to be a persistent trouble, right?

She stared at the infants to strike fear on their little spirits. They fired back running away with her hammer.

She opted for a training regime to tame their active bodies. They became better athletes and more energetic.

She felt her white hair become whiter. They loved her... they also tormented her.

She wanted to keep them safe. They wanted to explore.A compromise had to be made.

She travelled to the Vault, spending some time with the Wise expanding her knowledge. They idealised a rare element, a crystal that could link up their spirits, share their feelings and thoughts. Maybe this new element could help the Smith understand her little chaotic forces (as she called them) and without losing a beat, she set to create crystals for every elder and her twins.

The work was arduous, the crystal had to be forged over 100 days and 100 nights The elements had to glow just like the sun over the Golden City and the temperature had to be right. She worked hard and her efforts had paid off.

On her return to the forest, she spent the following years raising the Twins, becoming obsessed with her crystal, checking the whereabouts of her chaotic forces.

It didn't surprise her, a day when the Twins walked into her temple asking permission to explore the wonders beyond the shade of the forest. Her heart sunk and a knot prevented her from speaking up her mind. The only phrase that came out of her mouth was - *"I understand. Take your crystals and think me out every day. Take care."* - grabbing her hammer and started to work vigorously on a new project.

Once the Twins had left, she walked to the balcony, avoiding the debris on her eye (because there was no way the Smith was going to shed a tear) and taking a deep breath she noticed: high above one of the trees a pair of decorated eggs laid out of place. It was a testament the Twins had left a mark, one last joke in her forest.

Though many could see her eyebrow twitching, some noticed her humming as she walked back into the temple. The Star Children smiled with a bit of cheekiness. *There is a heart in the iron lady* - they thought.

Life in the forest returned to be peaceful, people could come and go as they pleased and nobody would notice. Just like the forest was hidden, its inhabitants and guests were as well; that was until the day the earth shook and trees fell.

The Star Children rushed to the temple to consult with the Smith what happened on that day. She was nowhere to be found. Hammer and anvil left unattended.

Many worried, others thought she had gone to inspect the health of the Twins. Another tremor shook the forest and the mount of Eden was bursting with flames up to the sky.

Thoughts turned into rumours, rumours in speculation and speculation into nervous uneasiness.

A herald arrived from the Golden City, they had to prepare to receive large flocks of refugees.

The Smith arrived with the first waves. She was great at thinking solutions and this emergency required her attention. Her organised and strict personality came to shine, preventing the chaos to reign over the forest, trying to control the Twins taught her valuable lessons to deal with disorder.

Many asked what had happened, she, reluctantly, told the story of the darkness descending from Eden and the efforts of those, trying to contain it.

Waves of refugees continued to arrive. She started to notice some were coming from Triumph.

Anxiety stroke her otherwise calm personality. She knew the Golden City and Vault were (possibly) lost but what happened at Triumph?

As more and more arrived, the Smith received the giant creatures guarding the Collector and Father, both wounded, tired and discouraged.

*Where are the Twins?* - she thought. The world was changing quickly around her but to her, everything had become a blur.

Father could tell the absence of her mind, how she had become a desperate mother looking for her lost children. He knew she was complete for a while though the ache was eating her alive. Hugged her as tight as he could, she didn't even notice and kept looking at her crystal for days to no end.

She did not notice the mist had become dense, the clouds grey and heavy, letting acid rain flowing on the forest. The rain would steal your light, put your flame off and turn you into dust.

She did not notice the black plants growing in her temple.

She did not notice everybody had left escaping the darkness spreading through the forest.

She did not notice her flame was slowing fading away.
Her attention fixated on the cracks spreading on her crystal and the absence of her children. She just noticed two stars missing from her favourite constellation.

And there she remained, her flame went out and she turned into dust, lost among the trees of the Hidden Forest.

# Little mental confabulations redacted to amuse
Probably not related to code, these little stories have been generated in my illogical section of my brain as I day dream through life.

I've written these stories as an attempt to flush these ideas in a more permanent repository, allowing me to turn it into cohesive tales that could be read when there is a bit of leisure time.
